00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.190
-Number one.
-Number one. Three, four.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.901
-Number two. Number three.
-Number two. Number three.

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:25.576
I think this is when
we need the most courage.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.830
We need it to keep moving forward.

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.133
We need to make it fun.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.344
Is it time to go?

00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:46.847
Let's bring the energy up.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.606
[HOSHI] Let's go have fun!

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:09.411
[DINO] How do we keep this teamwork going?

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:13.165
With all 13 of us?

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:15.251
It's getting harder.

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:17.586
Honestly, I'm really scared.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.755
[fans shouting, cheering]

00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:25.845
[S.COUPS] Ugh, I'm exhausted.

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:27.137
-Good luck.
-You got this.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.195
Like a bird taking flight again,

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.991
let's just focus on flying in this moment.

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:50.077
SEVENTEEN'S "RIGHT HERE"
WORLD TOUR KICKS OFF

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.955
AFTER YEARS OF PASSION AND CHALLENGE

00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:56.959
Let's go.

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.419
One, two, three.

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.088
[♪ sentimental song playing]

00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:05.551
[S.COUPS] I always hope

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:09.138
our relationships last a long time.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:20.441
He takes the lead and steps up
when something happens.

00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:25.321
He stands for us and speaks the truth.
"This needs to change."

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:27.823
He's a bold and assertive leader.

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:31.577
Even this fan meetup was arranged

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.370
without telling us the location.

00:23:33.454 --> 00:23:36.916
Every time, I wish
you'd tell us the location first.

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:39.752
I sometimes envy S.COUPS.

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:44.798
I wish I could speak up like that,
but it's not easy for me.

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:47.885
When I think about S.COUPS,
I think, "He's amazing."

00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:49.929
It's hard enough being in a team.

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:53.641
Imagine the pressure he must feel
as the leader.

00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:56.226
-We should pay closer attention.
-[SEUNGKWAN] I'm sorry.

00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:59.229
It looked like we were just phoning it in.

00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:02.274
I've been a bit forceful at times.

00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:04.485
That's my job.

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.279
If everyone is soft,

00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:11.408
there's no way a 13-member boy group
like this could function.

00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:14.536
But he also has a soft side.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.121
He feels like a close friend.

00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.958
S.COUPS has this cheerful energy.

00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:23.921
I was just telling HYELIM earlier that
when we were abroad for tours,

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:27.508
I used to hate going out
to go sightseeing or to hang out.

00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.010
But MINGYU changed all of that.

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:32.888
He'd drag me out and make me have fun.

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.891
[MINGYU] Did you miss MINGYU a lot today?

00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:37.851
I did.

00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:39.687
[MINGYU] You sound serious.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.064
-Yeah, I really missed him.
-Oh, you.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:44.566
You can film this. Can you hold this?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.901
-[MINGYU] I got it.
-Okay.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.782
For me, touring used to feel
overwhelming and exhausting.

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.827
Not because I didn't want to see the fans

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.206
but because of all the extra time
and energy it took.

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:03.377
But the person who made
even those moments feel joyful

00:25:04.128 --> 00:25:05.129
was MINGYU.

00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:07.339
[MINGYU] I'll drink to that.

00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:09.758
That's why I've been
enjoying the tour life

00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:12.344
-so much this year.
-[MINGYU sighs contentedly]

00:25:12.428 --> 00:25:13.887
It's been seriously fun.

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:15.264
All thanks to you.

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.807
-Yeah.
-I had fun too.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.686
So when we started touring again,
I didn't feel pressured.

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:24.565
I just thought of it as having fun
with the members again.

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:27.484
-Yeah, watching you like that...
-[DK] Yeah.

00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:28.986
It was nice to see that.

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:30.988
-Yeah.
-Seeing you do that.

00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:33.032
[DK] Seeing how you weren't backing out...

00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:34.867
-I was like, "Let's go."
-How nice.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.577
[DK] Our team was more at ease too.

00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:40.622
I learned so much on this tour.

00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:43.834
I was happy. Truly happy.

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:47.921
Out of the 10 years,
this tour made me the happiest.

00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:52.843
We were each other's number one.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.388
Each other's top priority, yeah.

00:25:56.472 --> 00:26:00.350
I think we were able to make it this far

00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:02.186
because we cared for each other.

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:05.272
I think this is the first time I'm saying

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:08.067
"thank you" to him like this.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:12.029
He was really young back then too.

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:17.785
But S.COUPS held us together.
He led all 13 of us.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:20.037
-This is the first time I'm saying this.
-[fans] Aw!

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.538
-Stop.
-[HOSHI] I'm really thankful.

00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:23.707
-I wanted to say that.
-[JOSHUA laughing] Man.

00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:25.000
-Stop talking.
-[HOSHI laughing]

00:26:25.084 --> 00:26:27.544
I teared up a bit, honestly.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.755
When HOSHI said that.

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:35.844
It meant so much to hear
those words from HOSHI.

00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:39.765
And honestly, I didn't think, um...

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.391
he'd think much of it.

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:42.601
Just...

00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:45.771
HOSHI has always had the mindset
that working hard is a given.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.566
So hearing him say that
really surprised me.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.820
It felt like
he acknowledged all my efforts.

00:26:53.737 --> 00:26:54.738
It meant so much.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.033
-[fans] Aw!
-I love you. I've never said that before.

00:26:58.117 --> 00:27:01.120
[MINGYU] I think that was what
S.COUPS wanted to hear the most.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.749
[WOOZI] If he had been a leader
who dragged us around by force,

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.501
we would've fallen apart.

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.586
[♪ sentimental song playing]

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.172

-[exclaims]
-[laughter]

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.386
[WOOZI] He's like a close friend.

00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.513
He brings everyone together.

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:22.516
He feels like a big brother
full of warmth.

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:25.602
[S.COUPS] I'm grateful for you.
I don't think I ever told you that.

00:27:25.686 --> 00:27:26.687
All right.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.313
[WOOZI] It turned out for the best.

00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:30.357
That's one of his greatest strengths.

00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:34.653
You got this. [laughs]

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:36.488
[S.COUPS] I think of them
as lifelong buddies.

00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:40.576
Even when we're old and gray,
it'll feel like we're just hanging out.

still doing okay? [chuckles]

Sink or swim, let's stick together as 13.

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:50.377
That's all I want.

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:53.755
[DK] Something hilarious happened today.

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:54.923
Right before "Oh My!"

00:27:55.007 --> 00:27:58.677
a bunch of the members
were sitting on the steps backstage.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.596
As I get up to climb up...

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:03.974
-[laughter]
-I'm serious.

00:28:04.057 --> 00:28:06.476
Five or six of them
were just sitting there...

00:28:08.145 --> 00:28:09.313
like this.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:13.066
-Come on, guys! Hang in there!
-[laughter]

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.568
Seriously.

00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:15.903
-It was funny.
-Hilarious.

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:19.615
[DINO] When we're on tour, we actually
talk a lot more than you'd think.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:23.327
Since we all stay on the same floor,

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.913
we hang out, catch up,
talk about everything.

00:28:25.996 --> 00:28:29.958
When we're overseas,
we all stay in the same hotel,

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:32.210
so we naturally end up having more talks.

00:28:32.294 --> 00:28:34.171
[WOOZI] We see each other all the time.

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:35.464
It feels dull sometimes.

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:38.759
But I think even those "dull"
relationships are precious.

00:28:38.842 --> 00:28:42.304
Lately, I feel like
we've gotten even closer.

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:46.016
Closer than before.
Back then, we were just so busy.

00:28:46.099 --> 00:28:49.561
We didn't have any breathing room.
Everyone was a little on edge.

00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:50.646
Everyone was.

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:53.941
But now, with a bit more room to breathe,
we've grown closer.

00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:55.067
We barely fight.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.818

-[HOSHI] Wen Jjun.

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:57.903

-[HOSHI] Wen Junhui!
-I'm...

I'm not up yet.

00:29:00.948 --> 00:29:01.949
[HYELIM] You're not?

00:29:02.032 --> 00:29:04.701
-[laughter]
-[MINGYU AND HOSHI] You're up right now.

00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:06.703
[HYELIM] How cute. [laughs]

00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:08.330
[laughing] Just pretend you're asleep.

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.873
But you're totally awake.

00:29:09.957 --> 00:29:13.335
-He's our official comedian.
-[HOSHI] You miss us?

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:14.419
Wen Junhui!

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.046
What's with that awkward laugh,
Wen Junhui?

00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.339
[JUN laughs weakly]

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:18.799
[laughter]

00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:20.425
[HOSHI] How's the filming going?

00:29:21.218 --> 00:29:22.344
[HYELIM] Hang in there.

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.054
-[S.COUPS.] Good job, everyone!
-[MINGYU] Bye.

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:26.932
Sadly, I wasn't able to join this tour.

00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:29.226
I've been filming for a drama.

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:31.645
But the shoot will wrap up soon,

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:35.816
and I'll be back on stage with them
to meet you all again.

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:38.694
[♪ serene music playing]

00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:45.993
It's been a while.

00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:47.828
We last saw him shooting Going SEVENTEEN.

00:29:48.328 --> 00:29:50.998
-It feels like yesterday. [laughs]
-[MINGYU] You got tan.

00:29:51.081 --> 00:29:52.207
His face got tanned.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.084
-I got a lot of sun.
-Your arms too.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.131
[JUN] I had been absent
for about three weeks to a month.

00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:01.383
Even if we don't see each other
for a while,

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:03.301
it never feels awkward.

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:06.096
Real friends don't ever get awkward.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:07.347
Yeah, seriously.

00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:08.932
[JUN laughs]

00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.350
[staff] JUN looks awkward.

00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:12.394
I think he is feeling pressured.

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:14.062
