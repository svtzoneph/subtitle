-[DINO] He is.

171
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,504
He's doing so well.

172
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,547
[in English] Do you know SEVENTEEN? Huh?

173
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,840
-A song.
-A song?

174
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,509
-[in Korean] A song.
-A song?

175
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,302
-[in English] "MAESTRO"?
-"MAESTRO"? Right. [chuckles]

176
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,637
-No way!
-"MAESTRO"? Right.

177
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,013
-No way!
-Oh my God!

178
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,098
-Really?
-Yes.

179
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,768
-[♪ vocalizing]
-Oh, yeah!

180
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,311
-[woman] No way.
-Do you like K-pop?

181
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,771
-[woman] Yes, I like it.
-Really?

182
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,106
What's your favorite group?

183
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,024
-Um...
-[whispers] Say SEVENTEEN.

184
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,359
[woman] SEVENTEEN.

185
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,735
-Yes!
-Hah!

186
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,612
No way. Really?

187
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,156
[SEUNGKWAN in Korean]
I'm not happy all the time.

188
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,493
I'm a bit of an emotional rollercoaster.

189
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,538
I think I'm someone
who knows how to appreciate

190
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,165
and be thankful
for the small, everyday things.

191
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,377
I can't just say,
"I'm totally happy right now!"

192
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,004
But I think I'm someone
who tries to find happiness

193
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,465
in as many things as possible, yes.

194
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:40,390
I just sit around
if I stay in the hotel all day.

195
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,352
But I get more energy
when I come out like this,

196
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,231
when I see how lively people are

197
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,525
as they go on with their lives.

198
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,153
Seeing SEUNGKWAN play volleyball

199
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,239
and getting a chance
to interact with children,

200
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,741
those moments make us feel more human.

201
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,162
I feel like we're more a part of life,

202
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,331
not just here to put on a show and work.

203
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,421
Okay.

204
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,383
I think the beef will be ready
in a moment.

205
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,467
[VERNON] Okay.

206
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,969
Are you hungry?

207
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,971
-[VERNON] I'm starving.
-[THE 8] Okay.

208
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,099
[VERNON] I feel like
I live a life of abundance.

209
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,059
I have enough time

210
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,980
to do the things I want to
despite our busy schedule,

211
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,231
so I'm happy with that.

212
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,028
I'm on my way to buy some senbei.

213
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,779
Senbei is

214
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,658
apparently a snack or a meal for the deer.

215
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,076
[indistinct chatter]

216
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,331
I just wanted to try it.

217
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:53,379
-I thought they were judging me.
-[staff laughing]

218
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,973
[HOSHI] We've been doing this
as a group for so long,

219
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,476
we don't know
what new things to try anymore.

220
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,896
We came out in units like BSS and HxW
because the timing was right,

221
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,064
so I can't not do it.

222
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,274
But I think I'm in need of a break.

223
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,487
I think I'm tired
of this overly stimulating world.

224
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,450
At times, people get attacked
for the things that aren't true.

225
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,870
So I want to step away
from this media world for a while.

[in Korean] No soba?
Do you want soba or tendon?

230
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,512
-I can go if you're getting soba.
-Really?

231
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,055
-Tendon is too heavy.
-Soba then?

232
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,598
-Let's get soba.
-Let's eat soba.

233
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,683
Do you want tendon?

00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,851
-I do, but let's get soba.
-All right.

235
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,687
-[SEUNGKWAN] All right.
-[MINGYU] Okay, then.

236
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,397
No more excuses.

237
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,816
Let's play two rounds
and go by the win rate.

238
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,277
-Yes. Let's go with the win rate.
-All right.

239
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,529

[SEUNGKWAN exclaims]

241
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,034
I want to paint at home
and also travel places.

242
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,079
I have to study English and Japanese
and work out too.

243
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,499
But I have to fit everything
into the spare moments of my schedule.

244
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,502
That's why life feels so hectic right now.

245
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,255
When I do find the time,
that is my way of relaxing.

246
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,842
I have to rest and take a break like that.

247
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,428
So that I'll get motivated
to come and work again.

248
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,432
Instead of forcing myself to work,

249
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,518
I want to be someone
who knows how to rest when necessary.

Gosh. Jeez. That was crazy.

Stop filming. I'm embarrassed.

[SEUNGKWAN] That was a good game.

When I'm touring overseas,

256
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,412
there comes a moment
when I don't even know where I am,

[WONWOO] About two years ago,

260
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,005
I began to think it was a shame

261
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,633
to spend my off days stuck inside my room.

262
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:14,062
Sometimes, I plan a full day
with no wiggle room,

263
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,983
and sometimes, I just wander aimlessly.

264
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,280
I do my best to enjoy
the local atmosphere.

265

how to empty ourselves.

[WONWOO] After getting some rest,

we'll naturally return

When I met BUMZU...

303
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,841
the first thing I asked him was,

304
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,636
"How do you punch in drums?"

305
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,598
I was either in 10th or 9th grade.

306
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,935
Our group wasn't supposed to be
a self-producing team,

307
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,354
even just months before our debut.

308
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,023
We were asked,
"Do any of you write music?"

309
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,317
I said, "I do, as a hobby."

310
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,569
They said, "Write one a week,"
and I said okay.

311
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,239
They picked three
from what I wrote and said,

312
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,449
"One of these three
will be your title track."

313
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,201
"Really?"

314
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,744
The three were...

315
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,666
"Adore U," "Shining Diamond,"

316
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,334
and "Pretty U."

317
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,046
It felt like our debut
was suddenly being fast-tracked.

318
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,839

to hear a song you wrote
come out into the world.

-Yes. I thought, "I guess this is normal."

that people like us.

My family isn't that well off,
so where else would I go if not here?

Back then, trainees who lived in dorms
didn't have anything in their pockets.

We couldn't afford in-ear monitors.

We couldn't.

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,472
We had to ask our parents for help, but...

[staff] What do you think you've gained
and lost as a member of SEVENTEEN?

864
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,561
[WOOZI] Basically, everything I gained
is thanks to being a part of SEVENTEEN.

CARATs, our members,

869
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,993
and everyone in my life,
I gained through SEVENTEEN.

870
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:09,081
If I were to point out
something I seemingly lost,

871
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:13,252
it'd probably be things like
living an ordinary life and all,

872
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,254
but in a way, it's still a gain.

873
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,591
I got to have all those things.
