00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:54.184
Always a hot night...

00:49:54.184 --> 00:49:55.273
Where are you sleeping?

00:49:55.273 --> 00:49:56.534
On the second floor.

00:49:56.534 --> 00:49:58.617
Good night.

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:02.036
[Bound for great sleep with good nights zzz]

[At this time, somebody
comes into the sleep zone]

[HOSHI soon heads outside with WOOZI]

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.405
Everyone is a little quiet today.

00:50:27.179 --> 00:50:30.269
- Oh my! The moon is pretty, Jihoon.
- That's true!

00:50:32.757 --> 00:50:34.981
[Briefly stopping on their way]

00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:35.351
Today,
[Briefly stopping on their way]

00:50:35.351 --> 00:50:37.635
we can see the stars well.
[Briefly stopping on their way
and looking up at the night sky]

00:50:37.659 --> 00:50:40.250
Wow...

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:43.195
It's insane.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.570
That wasn't the only bright one.

00:50:46.233 --> 00:50:50.539
That one with the 3 is that...
[(Stars)]

00:50:50.539 --> 00:50:53.280
I learned this when I was young...

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.684
How do those 3 shine like that?

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:57.885
Today is insane.
[Countless stars in the night sky in the forest]

00:50:58.509 --> 00:50:59.978
It's really insane.

00:50:59.978 --> 00:51:02.400
- Meanwhile, a plane is flying by.
- Yeah.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.510
I always think that.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.543
Whenever you're on a plane, you look out
the window and below at the ground, right?
[(Outside)]

00:51:06.744 --> 00:51:07.755
Then you can see

00:51:07.755 --> 00:51:09.775
regions like this.
[Countless people on the ground
seen from the sky]

00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:11.250
So when I see that...
[Countless people on the ground
seen from the sky]

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.204
I'm flying to another country like this,
[Countless people on the ground
seen from the sky]

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:15.380
but people below

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.804
are all each living their lives.
[Curious about others' lives]

00:51:18.804 --> 00:51:20.855
- Yeah. / - But it's the other way around now.
[Curious about others' lives]

00:51:20.855 --> 00:51:24.364
Someone is riding in that plane

00:51:24.364 --> 00:51:27.260
and flying somewhere
and has their own life.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.121
That's quite amazing.

00:51:30.121 --> 00:51:31.572
But I can

00:51:31.572 --> 00:51:33.414
see the stars really well. This is insane.
[The stars in the night sky bring a lot to mind]

00:51:33.414 --> 00:51:38.088
[The stars in the night sky bring a lot to mind]

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:42.385
I can see them so well that it's about to scare me.
[(The stars)]

00:51:42.385 --> 00:51:46.780
The sky is really high up.
[As the stars are shining, in the food zone]

00:51:47.351 --> 00:51:50.210
It's my dream to drink alcohol
at a cart bar.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:53.003
- It's pretty nice. / - I went once when
I went to Yeosu with my friend.
[DINO visited a cart bar with a friend in Yeosu]

00:51:53.003 --> 00:51:55.141
- That street with cart bars? / - Yes.
[(I know it)]

00:51:55.141 --> 00:51:56.166
But at the time,
[(I know it)]

00:51:56.166 --> 00:51:58.099
- there were a lot of people.
- Yeah, there are a lot there.

00:51:58.099 --> 00:52:01.300
- It's not easy to eat comfortably there.
- It wasn't comfortable.
[Couldn't comfortably enjoy the cart bar]

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.989
Being recognized could be okay,

00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:04.510
- but the conversation topics change.
- That's right!

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.228
How the conversation topics change
makes me uncomfortable.
[DINO agrees with MINGYU's point]

00:52:06.228 --> 00:52:08.980
I don't think things like that bother me lately.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:11.485
For example, if I go drink with MINGYU or

00:52:11.485 --> 00:52:14.755
the four of us go to drink outside

00:52:14.755 --> 00:52:16.994
at a cart bar or wherever we want,

00:52:16.994 --> 00:52:20.235
- nobody would point fingers at us!
- That's right.

00:52:20.693 --> 00:52:21.833
In some ways...

00:52:21.833 --> 00:52:23.570
It was during our debut...
[Cautious about everything
in their early debut days]

00:52:23.594 --> 00:52:27.659
- It was impossible back then.
- We were careful and created our image.
[Cautious about everything
in their early debut days]

00:52:27.885 --> 00:52:30.085
But even now, there's a need for that
to a certain extent.

00:52:30.085 --> 00:52:31.275
But it has disappeared a lot though.

00:52:31.894 --> 00:52:35.545
- And honestly, that's how many methods of
communication there are. / - It has opened up.
[Through various communication methods]

00:52:35.545 --> 00:52:39.231
- There are ways. / - That's why...
"I drank a bit with the members right now."
[Through various communication methods,
SEVENTEEN can share their daily lives with CARAT]

00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:41.775
Because we're showing more and more...
[Through various communication methods,
SEVENTEEN can share their daily lives with CARAT]

00:52:41.775 --> 00:52:45.699
For some reason, I like it when I meet
CARAT when I'm out drinking.

00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:48.746
When I meet them coincidentally!
So suddenly...

00:52:48.896 --> 00:52:52.436
Let's say I went to drink.
If I run into them, I like it!
[Meeting CARAT coincidentally
makes S.COUPS happy]

00:52:52.436 --> 00:52:53.561
Even as they pass by...

00:52:53.561 --> 00:52:57.579
"We have a lot of fans. There are CARATs."
[(Arounds us)]

00:52:57.579 --> 00:53:01.019
I met CARATs at a barbecue
restaurant in Daegu once.
[(Coincidentally)]

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.260
I gave them a drink and

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.000
I also received a drink and we drank together.
[A moment that will remain
a fun memory for S.COUPS]

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.637
I clinked glasses with them, drank,
came out, and paid for them.
[A moment that will remain
a fun memory for S.COUPS]

00:53:07.155 --> 00:53:09.525
At our fan signing a few days ago...

00:53:09.525 --> 00:53:12.130
There's this Japanese band that I like.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.731
But a fan came and I recommended that song.
[CARAT shared news of a new album
from a band that MINGYU recommended]

00:53:14.731 --> 00:53:16.541
They said that person released a new album.
[CARAT shared news of a new album
from a band that MINGYU recommended]

00:53:16.541 --> 00:53:20.067
But I don't think I had
ever seen that CARAT before

00:53:20.067 --> 00:53:21.159
based on my memory.

00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:22.335
In that short time,

00:53:22.335 --> 00:53:23.380
a new album came out.
[CARAT recommended a few tracks
off of the new album]

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.413
"Listen to this and this on that album."
[CARAT recommended a few tracks
off of the new album]

00:53:25.438 --> 00:53:27.867
"I'll come again tomorrow!"
She said this and left.
[CARAT recommended a few tracks
off of the new album]

00:53:28.237 --> 00:53:31.626
- But I was so curious.
- Yes, since it's also a singer you like.

00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:34.125
So I listened and it was so good!

00:53:34.525 --> 00:53:35.275
We met the second time and

00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:37.822
- that person was so memorable.
- Yes, that's inevitable.
[A precious memory where he connected
through music with a new CARAT]

00:53:37.822 --> 00:53:40.215
"I heard the song yesterday! It was so good."
[A precious memory where he connected
through music with a new CARAT]

00:53:40.215 --> 00:53:44.375
Because a song that my fan
recommended to me is on my playlist,

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.590
- that felt sort of weird.
- It was weird!

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:48.994
- It must be.
- The fans give good suggestions.

00:53:48.994 --> 00:53:51.172
- Because they know our ways well. / - Yeah.
[SEVENTEEN and CARAT
know each other better than anyone]

00:53:51.172 --> 00:53:53.420
They give me a lot of recommendations, too.
[SEVENTEEN and CARAT
know each other better than anyone]

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.585
What was really nice is that

00:53:55.585 --> 00:53:57.516
there was a fan

00:53:57.516 --> 00:53:59.929
that really loved Michael Jackson.

00:53:59.929 --> 00:54:01.711
- Michael Jackson?
- Yes. / - That's possible!

00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:05.018
- But that's not easy.
- We can't really relate.

00:54:05.018 --> 00:54:06.818
- It's not easy for our generation
- We can't really relate.

00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:09.574
- to fall for Michael Jackson.
- That's right.

00:54:09.925 --> 00:54:13.235
But she came to our fan signing
and said she likes Michael Jackson.
[DINO's role model that inspired him
to become a singer was Michael Jackson]

00:54:13.235 --> 00:54:14.585
I said a few songs that only I knew

00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.150
since Michael Jackson has so many famous songs.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.987
I said the song titles
and she knew them all!

00:54:20.987 --> 00:54:22.974
That's why I suddenly spoke casually.
[DINO was excited to share similar tastes]

00:54:22.974 --> 00:54:24.802
- "Wow, really?" / - You'd get excited, too!
[DINO was excited to share similar tastes]

00:54:24.802 --> 00:54:26.891
"How do you know this song?"
Saying things like this.
[DINO was excited to share similar tastes]

00:54:26.891 --> 00:54:29.380
It was so fun that
we could go back and forth.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.329
So I think those sorts of experiences are precious.

00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:33.269
It's very weird.

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.936
- I agree.
- It's really strange.

00:54:34.936 --> 00:54:36.646
People... I...
[(One more bottle...?)]

00:54:36.646 --> 00:54:39.396

I'm going to go today. It's okay!

Let's open another bottle!
I'm...

00:54:46.041 --> 00:54:49.375
Sir! We have appetizers left,
but there's no alcohol!

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.851
I think my life

00:54:51.851 --> 00:54:53.672
- is included in it. That concept is sort of...
- That's right.
[The conversation continues on all night]

[The conversation continues on all night
and bottles keep increasing]

00:54:59.465 --> 00:55:05.695

but I feel like I'm leaving with more.
