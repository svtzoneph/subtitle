00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.244
Just laugh.
[(Just said one thing)]

00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:38.246
- You are just at a high level now. Just.
- This is not funny.
[(Funny)]

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:41.027
But people burst out laughing
when he opens his mouth!

00:57:41.027 --> 00:57:43.105
- You became a happiness evangelist.
- Now, he...

00:57:43.105 --> 00:57:44.831
- His level is really high. Level's really high.
- Level's really high.

00:57:44.831 --> 00:57:46.760
DINO wasn't this funny long time ago.
[Funniest member these days]

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.652
But he's really...
[Funniest member these days]

00:57:47.652 --> 00:57:49.230
- I think he's funny.
- Yes, he got funny all of a sudden.
[Funniest member these days = DINO]

00:57:51.989 --> 00:57:53.230
It's coming up. You see it, right?

00:57:53.605 --> 00:57:54.543
Oh? Tree?

00:57:55.079 --> 00:57:59.909
- I need to go in. Good night!
- Good night.

00:58:00.663 --> 00:58:03.099
[Walking around now]

00:58:03.568 --> 00:58:07.402
- You didn't see JOSHUA, right?
- JOSHUA?

00:58:08.481 --> 00:58:10.452
Shoes are here.

00:58:10.452 --> 00:58:12.269
These are JOSHUA's shoes.

00:58:13.414 --> 00:58:14.496
He's sleeping.

00:58:15.516 --> 00:58:18.608
[Found JOSHUA in the playroom's
sweet dream zone]

00:58:21.255 --> 00:58:23.155
- You're sleeping here?
- Yes.

00:58:24.425 --> 00:58:26.710
Are you going to sleep here?

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.605
I slept here!

00:58:29.956 --> 00:58:31.523
[(Pat)]

00:58:35.097 --> 00:58:36.255
[Playroom]

00:58:36.255 --> 00:58:38.159
What should we eat?
[Playroom]

00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:40.349
But I also got kind of hungry, too.
[Playroom]

00:58:40.599 --> 00:58:42.123
Mian bao xia?

00:58:42.123 --> 00:58:44.210
- We have Mian bao xia? / - Yes.
[Take Mian bao xia]

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:45.545
I want to eat sweet and sour chicken, too.
[Take Mian bao xia and sweet and sour chicken]

00:58:45.545 --> 00:58:47.139
- Sweet and sour chicken is so nice. / - Yes.
[Take Mian bao xia and sweet and sour chicken]

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:50.994
- Should we go to the food zone?
- Should we?

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:55.014
- Let's take a look a bit.
- Let's look at it a bit and come back.
[Only looking and coming back]

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:57.920
We need to go once out of respect.
[JOSHUA, SEUNGKWAN going to
the food zone out of respect]

00:58:58.646 --> 00:58:59.916
Why is he laughing so much?
[...?]

00:58:59.965 --> 00:59:02.108
- I know. / - Does it look fun?
[DK who walked with SEUNGKWAN
is sudeenly a sleep mode]

00:59:02.777 --> 00:59:06.480
[Like that, JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
head towards the food zone...]

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.074
This is VERNON's voice.
[Like that, JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
head towards the food zone...]

00:59:08.074 --> 00:59:09.161
I guess he's still not sleeping.
[Like that, JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
head towards the food zone...]

00:59:10.824 --> 00:59:12.019
I guess he's not sleeping.

00:59:16.139 --> 00:59:16.889
The tree is now...

00:59:16.889 --> 00:59:19.438
I guess the humidity is leaving now.
[Sincere talks are going back
and forth in the fire pit zone]

00:59:19.438 --> 00:59:21.202
Smoke is coming up.
[Sincere talks are going back
and forth in the fire pit zone]

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.320
If my father didn't dance and sang really well,

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.469
- I would have sang, too.
- I'm sure.

00:59:26.469 --> 00:59:28.659
I think it's the coolest that I became a singer.

00:59:28.659 --> 00:59:31.110
- That's interesting for me, too.
- Me too.

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:33.429
I didn't have any thoughts of being a singer.

00:59:33.429 --> 00:59:35.644
You didn't have any thoughts of being a singer.

00:59:35.644 --> 00:59:36.440
Yes, I didn't.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.565
Aside from having any thoughts
of being a singer or not...

00:59:39.565 --> 00:59:42.014
- Just wasn't in my sight.
- Just a singer...?

00:59:42.014 --> 00:59:43.445
That's just good.
[Singer...?]

00:59:43.445 --> 00:59:45.065
I am here... "Firefighter"!
[(Suddenly)]

00:59:45.065 --> 00:59:46.096
Yes, yes!

00:59:46.096 --> 00:59:47.878
- It's kind of like that.
- It's like this.

00:59:47.878 --> 00:59:49.251
It's that feeling.

00:59:49.251 --> 00:59:51.090
Didn't even think or consider it.

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.532
But somehow became a trainee.

00:59:52.532 --> 00:59:53.523
That's kind of interesting for me, too.

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:54.891
When I do an interview...

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.644
"When did you start dreaming
about being an artist?"

00:59:56.644 --> 00:59:59.090
It's not that for me.
About quitting...
[(Trainee)]

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:00.539
I didn't accept my pride.

01:00:00.539 --> 01:00:02.295
Let's bear it and try it.

01:00:02.295 --> 01:00:04.389
What is this? It was kind of like this.
["Let's bear it and try it! What is this?!"]

01:00:04.389 --> 01:00:06.583
Hearing that, I right now...

01:00:06.583 --> 01:00:08.409
The thought that goes by right now...
[To me]

01:00:08.409 --> 01:00:11.389
Nevertheless, I think I am grateful

01:00:11.389 --> 01:00:14.217
that we are still here right now doing this.

01:00:14.217 --> 01:00:15.003
Yes.

01:00:15.003 --> 01:00:17.224
All these different people gathered...
[Such different 13 boys]

01:00:17.224 --> 01:00:19.190
Debuted and 2, 3 years and now 1, 2 years...
[Such different 13 boys]

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:20.608
This is how it became.

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:23.260
- We are looking for that.
- That's possible.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.144
What it feels like when we were trainees

01:00:25.144 --> 01:00:27.414
and when we were doing modern dance...

01:00:27.414 --> 01:00:29.405
We had dance lessons for 4 hours
each for two sessions.

01:00:29.405 --> 01:00:31.233
- 8 hours.
- That was really... Man.

01:00:31.233 --> 01:00:32.375
That day is just...

01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:34.820
It's not where you think
"My skills would get better by doing this".

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.585
- It's heavy. The day is heavy.
- Let's just live the day. Let's bear it...

01:00:38.128 --> 01:00:41.208
- How did we really live like that?
- And if we work really hard like that...

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:44.085
I would have been able to bear it if I had
the certainty that I would debut as SEVENTEEN.

01:00:44.085 --> 01:00:44.835
Of course.

01:00:44.835 --> 01:00:46.056
But there's nothing.

01:00:46.056 --> 01:00:48.474
There's nothing. You don't know
what's going to happen tomorrow

01:00:48.474 --> 01:00:50.235
- but we lived that hard.
- Whether we're doomed or not when we debut.
[Don't know what's going to happen tomorrow]

01:00:50.235 --> 01:00:52.097
No one knows.

01:00:52.097 --> 01:00:54.619
That's why 40, 50, 60 trainees all leave
[13 members that withstood that time]

01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:56.065
and this is what was left.
[13 members that withstood that time]

01:00:56.065 --> 01:00:59.608
- We need to respect our young selves.
- Just bearing it.
["We need to respect to our young selves"]

01:00:59.608 --> 01:01:02.146
To look at one thing really positively,

01:01:02.445 --> 01:01:03.550
there's that.

01:01:03.942 --> 01:01:06.195
Our schedules are really hard right now, too.

01:01:07.202 --> 01:01:09.820
There's that thought,
"We were able to do it then."

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:10.625
That's true.

01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:13.050
I was late to school once.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.329
There was a time when I got in trouble for a month.

01:01:15.329 --> 01:01:17.275
But do you know what
the punishment for a month was?

01:01:17.275 --> 01:01:19.461
Make one verse of a song per day and go.

01:01:20.164 --> 01:01:21.262
Which one? What?

01:01:21.262 --> 01:01:22.554
"One verse of a song" a day.

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.853
That's why you did a remix of "11:11".
[The backstory of "11:11" remix(?)]

01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:27.079
That's why I remixed "11:11".
[The backstory of "11:11" remix(?)]

01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:29.235
- That's why he remixed that.
- I. I started. I started that.
[The backstory of "11:11" remix(?)]

01:01:29.235 --> 01:01:31.684
- Really? / - I was so bored.
SEUNGKWAN, come here. I was doing that...
[The backstory of "11:11" remix(?)]

01:01:31.811 --> 01:01:34.414
I wouldn't gain. Get full even if I ate.

01:01:34.614 --> 01:01:38.170
But there were a lot of people
where they would tell them to do things
that didn't make sense.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:39.344
MINGYU.
[MINGYU,]

01:01:39.344 --> 01:01:41.150
- SEUNGKWAN. / - Oh, yes.
[MINGYU, SEUNGKWAN]

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:44.554
But if you look at it,
it might have been helpful.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.195
- So funny. / - It's such a memory.
- In the practice room then.
[Memory talk that doesn't stop]

01:01:48.451 --> 01:01:50.753
I couldn't sleep a lot then

01:01:50.753 --> 01:01:53.172
so I went into the bathroom to sleep.

01:01:53.172 --> 01:01:55.364
He would come in there urgently.
[(Manager)]

01:01:55.364 --> 01:01:56.744
But I wasn't there.
[He came]

01:01:56.744 --> 01:01:59.766
So, everyone was all over the place.
Where is DINO? The door is locked.
[Interested]

01:01:59.766 --> 01:02:01.811
"He is 100 percent sleeping!"

01:02:01.949 --> 01:02:04.750
- We thought at that time he's sleeping
when the bathroom door is locked.
- Yes.

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:07.510
- Of course.
- "He's sleeping." So, S.COUPS...

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:09.523
He's was so mad.
[(14 years old DINO at that time)]

01:02:09.722 --> 01:02:12.518
Came out, "What were you doing?"

01:02:12.518 --> 01:02:16.184
Sorry! I fell asleep while I was pooping.

01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:19.050
So, "I was so tired..."
[Kekekekekekekekekekekeke]

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.990
He knows I am so tired.
[Fear at that time that won the shame kekeke]

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:25.106
- A 14 year old couldn't say,
"I dozed off because I was so tired." / - Really.
[Fear at that time that won the shame kekeke]

01:02:26.463 --> 01:02:28.809
- What human says that.
- What dude! What dude!

01:02:29.184 --> 01:02:30.134
Oh, my stomach hurts so much!
[What dude(?)]

- No.

Even if you stay up for 3 days...
[Trip down memory lane that's fun
no matter how many times you talk about]

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.394
- You don't sleep while you poop.
- You would rather...
[So funny]

01:02:42.394 --> 01:02:43.804
You should have said that there was
no toilet paper while pooping.
[So funny]

01:02:44.739 --> 01:02:45.557
Crazy.

01:02:45.557 --> 01:02:47.125
So, S.COUPS...!

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:48.829
- He said it. / - I think that's S.COUPS?
[...Isn't that S.COUPS?]

No?

Is it S.COUPS?

- Really speak of the devil.
- Yes. Speak of the devil.

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:57.610
I'm getting goosebumps. Goosebumps.

you talk about him Kekeke]

- That was the most I used my brain in that state.
- I know.

01:03:05.893 --> 01:03:07.594
That's the only excuse that I can say.

01:03:07.594 --> 01:03:09.434
- We were talking about when we were trainees.
Trainee talk.
- Trainee talk.

That middle school kid...

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:12.322
But do you know what gives
me more goosebumps?

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.322
He doesn't get old after 10 years.
[Time]

01:03:14.322 --> 01:03:15.072
That face is...

01:03:15.072 --> 01:03:16.356
- His face is when he was a trainee.
- It's exactly that.
[He looks the same as when he
did when he was a trainee!]

- He looks the same. / - We look the same as then.
[He looks the same as when he
did when he was a trainee!]

01:03:18.932 --> 01:03:20.190
Really the same.
[He looks the same as when he
did when he was a trainee!]

01:03:20.315 --> 01:03:23.268
I thought that I was hearing things
when I was sleeping.

01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:24.568
Laughing sounds...

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:28.331
- It was really quiet, this moment...
- I heard things and then I didn't.

01:03:28.331 --> 01:03:29.980
- There's nothing better than things about the past.
- Really.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.679
- Side dish is really just old talk.
- It's honestly giving us that we got old.

It's not even less than a year ago.
[Memories from less than 10 years ago]

- No. Less than 10 years ago.
- About 10 years ago. / - 10 years ago.
[About 10 years ago]

It's really about 10 years ago.
[Memories from about 10 years ago]

01:03:39.838 --> 01:03:40.664
Should we make some kimchi fried rice
and go to sleep?

01:03:40.664 --> 01:03:42.302
No. We need to hold it in.

01:03:42.474 --> 01:03:44.065
What do you mean hold it?
Don't hold back.

01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:45.954
This place is heaven.

01:04:00.105 --> 01:04:02.460
I am getting a bit faster.

01:04:02.925 --> 01:04:06.210
I know! If there's a time machine now,
[While JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
is finding the feeling(?)]

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.420
I was to tell 10 years old DINO.
[While JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
is finding the feeling(?)]

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.195
To Chan.
[While JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
is finding the feeling(?),
three people have a nice walk]

01:04:09.195 --> 01:04:10.139
What?
[While JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
is finding the feeling(?),
three people have a nice walk]

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:12.175
- Chan, it's okay. / - S.COUPS.
[While JOSHUA and SEUNGKWAN
is finding the feeling(?),
three people have a nice walk]

01:04:12.175 --> 01:04:14.574
- Boil and cook it.
- You just need to live and withstand it.

01:04:15.344 --> 01:04:16.519
Yes, that's right.

01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:19.512
- We are going around once here.
- No, why does it smell like sesame oil?
[Covering the forest in the night]

01:04:19.512 --> 01:04:21.132
The savory smell...
[Sesame oil that is covering
the forest in the night...?!]

01:04:21.132 --> 01:04:22.054
I want to eat.
[Sesame oil that is covering
the forest in the night...?!]

01:04:22.054 --> 01:04:24.554
What is that smoke?

01:04:24.554 --> 01:04:25.635
What's up with the smoke?
[What is that smoke?!]

01:04:25.635 --> 01:04:26.338
What are you guys doing?

01:04:26.338 --> 01:04:27.784
There are clouds in here.
[Cloud controversy]

01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.375
There's some kind of cloud on top.
[Cloud controversy]

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:30.255
Hey! There's a cloud. Window!
[Cloud controversy]

01:04:30.255 --> 01:04:32.277
What? What do we do? Open it.
[The cloudy smoke that is filled in the food zone...]

01:04:32.277 --> 01:04:34.269
There are clouds here.
[Is oil smoke]

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:36.219
We died and are born again.
[Is oil smoke]

01:04:36.219 --> 01:04:37.146
- Why?
- No.

01:04:37.146 --> 01:04:40.135
The oil was so strong in the beginning
and it burned right away.

01:04:41.108 --> 01:04:42.110
Are you okay?

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:43.577
It's okay. It didn't burn.

01:04:44.077 --> 01:04:48.496
[SEUNGKWAN can't close his mouth]

01:04:48.496 --> 01:04:50.909
[Look at the color]

01:04:50.909 --> 01:04:52.204
The visual is awesome.
[Look at the color]

01:04:55.554 --> 01:04:57.009
- I hope that it's good.
- It smells like kkanpunggi.

01:04:57.009 --> 01:04:57.608
Kkanpunggi.

01:04:57.608 --> 01:04:59.139
It kind of looks like kkanpunggi.

01:04:59.139 --> 01:05:01.215
Put some green onions and
powdered red pepper on it, too.
[Recommend green onions&powdered red pepper!]

01:05:01.215 --> 01:05:02.268
Let's chop some peppers.
[Recommend green onions&powdered red pepper!]

01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:05.630
- Sweet and sour chicken.
- It's sweet and sour chicken?
[Chicken was successful in getting revived
with JOSHUA's sauce!]

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:07.967
- You are good at making it. / - Me too.
[Chicken was successful in getting revived
with JOSHUA's sauce!]

01:05:08.353 --> 01:05:09.456
Let's go.

01:05:10.844 --> 01:05:13.925
You go there first.
I will do the dishes and go.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.844
- At 3 in the morning... There won't be an idol
who fries chicken? Right?
- It's really spicy.

01:05:17.844 --> 01:05:18.974
Amazing.

01:05:18.974 --> 01:05:20.722
But try this. It's crazy good.

01:05:20.722 --> 01:05:22.918
Hurry up and put the meat in.
Let's eat when the members come.

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:26.092
No one brought the chopsticks.
[※But there are no chopsticks※]

01:05:26.092 --> 01:05:28.429
You're right.
[※But there are no chopsticks※]

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:30.596
- Good work.
- Good work.

01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:32.385
Did you bring chopsticks?

01:05:32.385 --> 01:05:34.315
Don't you think the members took them?
[Chopsticks?]

01:05:34.315 --> 01:05:36.440
Did you bring chopsticks?

01:05:36.815 --> 01:05:39.635
- No chopsticks. / - Oh man.

There's no Co* zero, too.

01:05:42.295 --> 01:05:46.150
Do you guys not have hands?

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.510
I have SEUNGKWAN.
[!>.<]

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:49.721
I guess they are coming.

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:58.492
WOOZI, DINO, SEUNGKWAN,
JOSHUA, MINGYU, S.COUPS, DK.

01:05:58.492 --> 01:05:59.242
DK?

01:05:59.797 --> 01:06:03.780
MINGYU, S.COUPS, SEUNGKWAN.
[Calmly gets chopsticks and heads to the fire pit]

01:06:04.568 --> 01:06:06.295
Can you get one and give it to me?

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:07.398
Wait.

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:08.746
This is also a vibe.
[(Om nom nom)]

01:06:08.746 --> 01:06:10.730

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:11.998
The song is nice.
[(Om nom nom)]

01:06:12.472 --> 01:06:16.364
It feels like it's not cooked
because it's tender to me.
[(Chicken meat)]

01:06:16.364 --> 01:06:17.293
It's so tender.
[(Chicken meat)]

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.452
I am going to go home when that all burns.
[Sweet and sour party at 3 a.m. in the morning]

01:06:20.452 --> 01:06:21.820
I think it's going to be there until the morning.
[Sweet and sour party at 3 a.m. in the morning]

01:06:27.391 --> 01:06:29.079
Why?

01:06:29.079 --> 01:06:30.731
Why do you like it so much?

01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:32.746
Just at this time...

01:06:32.746 --> 01:06:35.568
I like that all the members are here!

01:06:35.568 --> 01:06:38.664
I slept in the playroom.

01:06:38.664 --> 01:06:40.353
- Why does everyone go sleep at the playroom?
- No, the playroom...

01:06:40.353 --> 01:06:42.394
- You sleep really well there.
- You sleep really well at the playroom. / - You do.
[Experienced sleeper1] [Experienced sleeper2]
[Experienced sleeper3]

01:06:42.394 --> 01:06:44.206
- You sleep well there. / - The temperature is perfect.
[Experienced sleeper1] [Experienced sleeper2]
[Experienced sleeper3]

01:06:44.206 --> 01:06:48.063
You can't get out when you lie down in the sofa.
[Temperature that brings sleep
and the comfiness of the sofa]

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.768
And you know how you can't sleep if it's too quiet?

01:06:51.768 --> 01:06:52.505
I know what that is.

01:06:52.505 --> 01:06:55.594
So, when the members are talking
loudly in the side...

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:59.210
- If I am sleeping and they're being funny...
- I would say it's funny and lose my energy.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:01.802
A couple of ballads come out in a row.

01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:05.099
Then, you go!
[Into your dreams]

01:07:05.423 --> 01:07:09.074
But I think that SEUNGKWAN is really on
his cheating day whenever he comes here.

01:07:09.074 --> 01:07:10.380
[Totally agrees]

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.998
- Yes. / - Completely.
[Totally agrees]

01:07:13.164 --> 01:07:16.625
Anyway, WOOZI... Didn't you see me
drinking for three or four days straight?
[WOOZI stays with the members in the morning]

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:17.438
- Yes! You're here often. / - Right?
[WOOZI stays with the members in the morning]

01:07:17.438 --> 01:07:19.748
Right? Starting from Singapore.

01:07:20.844 --> 01:07:24.574
[(Charges his breath)]

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:26.739
If a big piece of wood is going to burn...

01:07:26.739 --> 01:07:28.934
- I think we need to stay until morning.
- That...

When you blow it with your breath...
[TIP from a self proclaimed breath master(?)]

01:07:30.704 --> 01:07:35.101
You need to blow it for a long time
with a medium strength breath.
Light as possible.
[TIP from a self proclaimed breath master(?)]

01:07:35.101 --> 01:07:35.942
At least for 5 seconds.

01:07:35.942 --> 01:07:36.766
Look carefully.

01:07:38.483 --> 01:07:42.858
[And demonstration that he shows himself]

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:45.269
Don't your eyes burn?

01:07:45.552 --> 01:07:46.867
Closer.

01:07:46.867 --> 01:07:48.594
- Go a bit more.
- Bit more closer.

- You're good. / - It burns right away.
[Fire that burns strong]

01:07:52.784 --> 01:07:53.635
What is this?

01:07:53.635 --> 01:07:55.489
This is DINO.
[^O^]

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:59.755
I hope that he really burns.

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.760
I really don't know about anyone else.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.740
I think I would beat SEUNGKWAN.

01:08:07.688 --> 01:08:11.541
- I will bring it if you beat me in a fight today.
- You! You die. You die and I will die.
[(Requests in a life or death fight)]

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:14.564
He's nice so he can't say,
"No, I can beat you".

01:08:14.564 --> 01:08:16.158
- But he really thinks that he will lose.
- What!

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.456
You think that I am like this because I'm scared?!
[(He's a complete fighter)]

01:08:17.456 --> 01:08:20.235
Kind of scared. Kind of scared.
[(He's a complete fighter)]

01:08:20.536 --> 01:08:23.230
You worked hard in pumping weights?

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:25.470
No, aside from all of that...

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:26.261
But I...

01:08:26.261 --> 01:08:28.391
SEUNGKWAN.
[Taking this mood and saying his honest thoughts]

01:08:28.391 --> 01:08:31.396
There's a lot that I learn as the youngest.

01:08:31.396 --> 01:08:32.697
- You?
- Yes.

01:08:32.697 --> 01:08:33.860
- From us?
- When you're on a team.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.144
Yes, really.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:39.925
Because the good thing about
being the youngest is that.
[What DINO thinks is a good thing
about being SEVENTEEN's youngest]

01:08:39.925 --> 01:08:43.369
Some members lived this kind of life
and others lived this kind of life.
[The fact that he can get different kinds
of energy from 12 members]

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.335
I learn a lot from that.
[The fact that he can get different kinds
of energy from 12 members]

01:08:45.335 --> 01:08:47.770
But DINO, that...

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:50.130
It's not because you're the youngest.

01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:52.404
There's something that I learn
from the younger members, too.

01:08:52.404 --> 01:08:54.980
Like how you feel something while you look at us,

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.895
just things around me.

01:08:55.921 --> 01:08:57.708
You realize things while looking at the 12 members.
[Not because you're the youngest but it's
possible since you're a member of a team]

01:08:57.708 --> 01:08:59.123
It's not different because you're the youngest.
[Not because you're the youngest but it's
possible since you're a member of a team]

01:08:59.123 --> 01:08:59.990
I see.
[Not because you're the youngest
but it's possible because you're a member of a team]

01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:01.619
I realize a lot, too.

01:09:01.619 --> 01:09:04.234
Of course! I realize things because
I'm one member of a team, too.
["That's why I am so grateful to the members"]

01:09:04.234 --> 01:09:06.590
- Yes, that's right. / - I think so.
["That's why I am so grateful to the members"]

01:09:06.715 --> 01:09:08.320
That's why I am so grateful.
["That's why I am so grateful to the members"]

01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:11.345
I'm going to be honest.
I think that all 13 of us are the same.

01:09:11.345 --> 01:09:12.371
What's the same?

01:09:12.371 --> 01:09:14.860
S.COUPS has more experience
because he's 2 years older than me?

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.930
I'm sure he did when he was young.

01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:18.164
Since I was in middle school,

01:09:18.164 --> 01:09:20.056
we went through the same things.
[13 of them headed towards the same
thing since they were trainees]

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:21.685
We're the same.
[13 of them headed towards the same
thing since they were trainees]

01:09:21.685 --> 01:09:22.435
I...
[13 of them headed towards the same
thing since they were trainees]

01:09:22.435 --> 01:09:24.989
Since he's 2 years older than me,
he went through this so I will soon.

01:09:25.715 --> 01:09:27.935
To be honest, you might feel that physically.
[Different, various energy that
came from the same experience]

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:30.470
All 13 of us are very different.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.319
Members do it like this. He does it like this.
[We fill our weak points while looking
at each other in aligned with each other]

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.619
It's not a problem with age
but I think it's a problem with the person.
[We fill our weak points while looking
at each other in aligned with each other]

01:09:35.619 --> 01:09:38.454
It's the character's problem.
[We fill our weak points while looking
at each other in aligned with each other]

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.340
But I thought about that.

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:43.720
The worries while living as SEVENTEEN.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.569
My own personality while living by myself

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:48.104
and I feel like it's kind of changing.

01:09:48.523 --> 01:09:52.256
That's why I was very courageous and said
what I said when I drank tea with you.

01:09:52.407 --> 01:09:54.015

What was it?

01:09:59.914 --> 01:10:02.154
Is it okay for me to be upset?

01:10:02.154 --> 01:10:03.453
What did he say?

01:10:03.453 --> 01:10:07.780
- So, there were a couple of things.
- When we talked about each other.
[Overload on topics]

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.899
He's upset.

01:10:09.297 --> 01:10:10.640
No, I am not upset.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.220
I will pay for "In the SOOP"
and watch it separately.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.560
Yes.

01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:20.011
It was nice today.

01:10:21.046 --> 01:10:24.309
As long as we were happy.
[SEVENTEEN's time where it
was hotter than day passed]

01:10:25.759 --> 01:10:29.179
[In the meantime, the day breaks]

01:10:29.179 --> 01:10:32.293
We said that we would stay until
the big piece of wood is done burning but it's done.

01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:33.988
- Keep the promise.
- Unbelievable.

[Stayed up all night because
it's been a while talking like this]

01:28:44.554 --> 01:28:46.283
Drink.
[End of the day is obviously alcohol!]

01:28:46.283 --> 01:28:47.934
Aren't you just a player?

01:28:47.934 --> 01:28:49.150
"In the SOOP" is normally...

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:51.212
It's hard when you leave the forest.
[MINGYU's thoughts]

01:28:51.212 --> 01:28:56.216
[Scenery that is out like a panorama]

01:28:56.216 --> 01:28:57.199
It's cool.

01:28:57.199 --> 01:29:00.715
I should eat at the camping site today.
[Camp zone]

01:29:00.715 --> 01:29:03.020
Let's eat it at the campfire!
[Camp zone]

01:29:03.944 --> 01:29:07.015
- The sun already set!
- I want to do it before the sun sets.

01:29:07.015 --> 01:29:08.725
The sun sets too fast, right?

01:29:08.725 --> 01:29:11.631
- The sun sets before 6 p.m.
- I know.

01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:14.079
But MINGYU...

01:29:14.079 --> 01:29:15.744
It's only p.m.!
[Checks time]

01:29:15.744 --> 01:29:18.324
I think it's going to be 6 p.m.
when we go up to the temple and go back.

01:29:18.324 --> 01:29:19.175
Oh really?

01:29:19.175 --> 01:29:21.694
- We need to run up!
- Run up?

01:29:22.476 --> 01:29:26.539
We would have looked cool if
all three of us ride Har*, right?
[Motorcycles]

01:29:26.539 --> 01:29:30.520
Yes. We're in America if we ride like that.
[(Let's ride together)]

01:29:33.685 --> 01:29:35.890
Crazy.
[Heading towards Cheongnyangsa
where the mountain team went to]

01:29:35.890 --> 01:29:37.716
Is this the temple?

Is the place we're going Cheongnyangsa?
[Heading towards Cheongnyangsa

Yes, Cheongnyangsa.

Cheongnyangsan Provincial Park.

01:29:43.485 --> 01:29:46.060
Provincial Park.
[Decide to go up to Cheongnyangsa!]

Come over here.
[(Flustered)]

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.005
You need to press down on your legs and go up.
[Stimulating your muscles is a must!]

01:30:21.404 --> 01:30:26.377
How long has it been working out like this?

01:30:26.377 --> 01:30:28.172
I think it's been a really long time.

01:30:28.172 --> 01:30:29.503
Hasn't Cheonggyesan been the last for you?

01:30:29.503 --> 01:30:32.573
Cheonggyesan was the last for you, too?
So, the proper one...

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.899
This slope is the worst.
[Flustered] [(Took off all their jackets in no time)]

01:31:02.024 --> 01:31:04.579
[A slope that makes them kind of flustered(?)]

01:31:04.579 --> 01:31:05.840
- WONWOO.
- Yes?

I am really satisfied that there are stairs.
