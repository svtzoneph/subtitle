[Briefly stopping on their way]

1233

1234
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,351
Today,
[Briefly stopping on their way]

1234

1235
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:37,635
we can see the stars well.
[Briefly stopping on their way
and looking up at the night sky]

1235

1236
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,250
Wow...

1236

1237
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,195
It's insane.

1237

1238
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,570
That wasn't the only bright one.

1238

1239
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:50,539
That one with the 3 is that...
[(Stars)]

1239

1240
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:53,280
I learned this when I was young...

1240

1241
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,684
How do those 3 shine like that?

1241

1242
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,885
Today is insane.
[Countless stars in the night sky in the forest]

1242

1243
00:50:58,509 --> 00:50:59,978
It's really insane.

1243

1244
00:50:59,978 --> 00:51:02,400
- Meanwhile, a plane is flying by.
- Yeah.

1244

1245
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,510
I always think that.

1245

1246
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,543
Whenever you're on a plane, you look out
the window and below at the ground, right?
[(Outside)]

1246

1247
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:07,755
Then you can see

1247

1248
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:09,775
regions like this.
[Countless people on the ground
seen from the sky]

1248

1249
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,250
So when I see that...
[Countless people on the ground
seen from the sky]

1249

1250
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,204
I'm flying to another country like this,
[Countless people on the ground
seen from the sky]

1250

1251
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,380
but people below

1251

1252
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,804
are all each living their lives.
[Curious about others' lives]

1252

1253
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,855
- Yeah. / - But it's the other way around now.
[Curious about others' lives]

1253

1254
00:51:20,855 --> 00:51:24,364
Someone is riding in that plane

1254

1255
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:27,260
and flying somewhere
and has their own life.

1255

1256
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,121
That's quite amazing.

1256

1257
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,572
But I can

1257

1258
00:51:31,572 --> 00:51:33,414
see the stars really well. This is insane.
[The stars in the night sky bring a lot to mind]

1258

1259
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:38,088
[The stars in the night sky bring a lot to mind]

1259

1260
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,385
I can see them so well that it's about to scare me.
[(The stars)]

1260

1261
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:46,780
The sky is really high up.
[As the stars are shining, in the food zone]

1261

1262
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:50,210
It's my dream to drink alcohol
at a cart bar.

1262

1263
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,003
- It's pretty nice. / - I went once when
I went to Yeosu with my friend.
[DINO visited a cart bar with a friend in Yeosu]

1263

1264
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:55,141
- That street with cart bars? / - Yes.
[(I know it)]

1264

1265
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:56,166
But at the time,
[(I know it)]

1265

1266
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,099
- there were a lot of people.
- Yeah, there are a lot there.

1266

1267
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:01,300
- It's not easy to eat comfortably there.
- It wasn't comfortable.
[Couldn't comfortably enjoy the cart bar]

1267

1268
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,989
Being recognized could be okay,

1268

1269
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,510
- but the conversation topics change.
- That's right!

1269

1270
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,228
How the conversation topics change
makes me uncomfortable.
[DINO agrees with MINGYU's point]

1270

1271
00:52:06,228 --> 00:52:08,980
I don't think things like that bother me lately.

1271

1272
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,485
For example, if I go drink with MINGYU or

1272

1273
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:14,755
the four of us go to drink outside

1273

1274
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:16,994
at a cart bar or wherever we want,

1274

1275
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:20,235
- nobody would point fingers at us!
- That's right.

1275

1276
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:21,833
In some ways...

1276

1277
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,570
It was during our debut...
[Cautious about everything
in their early debut days]

1277

1278
00:52:23,594 --> 00:52:27,659
- It was impossible back then.
- We were careful and created our image.
[Cautious about everything
in their early debut days]

1278

1279
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:30,085
But even now, there's a need for that
to a certain extent.

1279

1280
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:31,275
But it has disappeared a lot though.

1280

1281
00:52:31,894 --> 00:52:35,545
- And honestly, that's how many methods of
communication there are. / - It has opened up.
[Through various communication methods]

1281

1282
00:52:35,545 --> 00:52:39,231
- There are ways. / - That's why...
"I drank a bit with the members right now."
[Through various communication methods,
SEVENTEEN can share their daily lives with CARAT]

1282

1283

Because we're showing more and more...
[Through various communication methods,
SEVENTEEN can share their daily lives with CARAT]

1283

1284
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:45,699
For some reason, I like it when I meet
CARAT when I'm out drinking.

1284

1285
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,746
When I meet them coincidentally!
So suddenly...

1285

1286
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:52,436
Let's say I went to drink.
If I run into them, I like it!
[Meeting CARAT coincidentally
makes S.COUPS happy]

1286

1287

Even as they pass by...

1287

1288
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:57,579
"We have a lot of fans. There are CARATs."
[(Arounds us)]

1288

1289
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:01,019
I met CARATs at a barbecue
restaurant in Daegu once.
[(Coincidentally)]

1289

1290
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,260
I gave them a drink and

1290

1291
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,000
I also received a drink and we drank together.
[A moment that will remain
a fun memory for S.COUPS]

1291

1292
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,637
I clinked glasses with them, drank,
came out, and paid for them.
[A moment that will remain
a fun memory for S.COUPS]

1292

1293
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:09,525
At our fan signing a few days ago...

1293

1294
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:12,130
There's this Japanese band that I like.

1294

1295
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,731
But a fan came and I recommended that song.
[CARAT shared news of a new album
from a band that MINGYU recommended]

1295

1296
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:16,541
They said that person released a new album.

from a band that MINGYU recommended]

1296

1297
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:20,067
But I don't think I had
ever seen that CARAT before

1297

1298
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:21,159
based on my memory.

1298

1299
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,335
In that short time,

1299

1300
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:23,380
a new album came out.
[CARAT recommended a few tracks
off of the new album]

1300

1301
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,413
"Listen to this and this on that album."
[CARAT recommended a few tracks
off of the new album]

1301

1302
00:53:25,438 --> 00:53:27,867
"I'll come again tomorrow!"
She said this and left.
[CARAT recommended a few tracks
off of the new album]

1302

1303
00:53:28,237 --> 00:53:31,626
- But I was so curious.
- Yes, since it's also a singer you like.

1303

1304
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:34,125
So I listened and it was so good!

1304

1305
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:35,275
We met the second time and

1305

1306
00:53:35,275 --> 00:53:37,822
- that person was so memorable.
- Yes, that's inevitable.
[A precious memory where he connected
through music with a new CARAT]

1306

1307
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:40,215
"I heard the song yesterday! It was so good."
[A precious memory where he connected
through music with a new CARAT]

1307

1308
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:44,375
Because a song that my fan
recommended to me is on my playlist,

1308

1309
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,590
- that felt sort of weird.
- It was weird!

1309

1310
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,994
- It must be.
- The fans give good suggestions.

1310

1311
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:51,172
- Because they know our ways well. / - Yeah.

know each other better than anyone]

know each other better than anyone]

1312

1313
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,585
What was really nice is that

1313

1314
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:57,516
there was a fan

1314

1315
00:53:57,516 --> 00:53:59,929
that really loved Michael Jackson.

1315

1316
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:01,711
- Michael Jackson?
- Yes. / - That's possible!

1316

1317
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:05,018
- But that's not easy.
- We can't really relate.

1317

1318
00:54:05,018 --> 00:54:06,818
- It's not easy for our generation
- We can't really relate.

1318

1319
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,574
- to fall for Michael Jackson.
- That's right.

1319

1320
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:13,235
But she came to our fan signing
and said she likes Michael Jackson.
[DINO's role model that inspired him
to become a singer was Michael Jackson]

1320

1321
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:14,585
I said a few songs that only I knew

1321

1322
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,150
since Michael Jackson has so many famous songs.

1322

1323
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:20,987
I said the song titles
and she knew them all!

1323

1324
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:22,974
That's why I suddenly spoke casually.
[DINO was excited to share similar tastes]

1324

1325
00:54:22,974 --> 00:54:24,802

[DINO was excited to share similar tastes]

1325

1326

"How do you know this song?"
Saying things like this.
[DINO was excited to share similar tastes]

1326

1327
00:54:26,891 --> 00:54:29,380
It was so fun that
we could go back and forth.

1327

1328
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,329
So I think those sorts of experiences are precious.

1328

1329
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:33,269
It's very weird.

1329

1330
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,936
- I agree.
- It's really strange.

1330

1331
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,646
People... I...
[(One more bottle...?)]

1331

1332
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:39,396
I predicted it!
I'm going to go today. It's okay!

1332

1333
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:42,110
Let's open another bottle!

1334

1335
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:49,375
Sir! We have appetizers left,
but there's no alcohol!

1335

1336
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:51,851
I think my life

1336

1337
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,672
- is included in it. That concept is sort of...
- That's right.
[The conversation continues on all night]

1337

1338
00:54:53,672 --> 00:54:55,599
- Just... / - You didn't light the fire. There's that.
[The conversation continues on all night]

It needs to be combined.

and bottles keep increasing]

1341

1342
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:05,695
I was really worried about "IN THE SOOP",
but I feel like I'm leaving with more.
