867

- 1, 2, 3! / - Hold on. Let me defend myself!
[The mafia is MINGYU?!]

867

868
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,610
- Okay. Defend yourself.
- Let's listen to his defense.

868

869
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,402
Why is it me?
[(Mafia)]

869

870
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:01,135
It's you!
[Just because]

870

871
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:03,289
- Yeah, but there should be a reason.
- He's the doctor.

871

872
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:05,925
- Okay. Let's go. It's you. / - It's not me.
[Ganging up on mafia = no particular reason]

872

873
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,376
- Why is it me? The doctor should've
saved WOOZI! / - Please raise your thumb.
[Unfair for MINGYU]

873

874
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,719
- Why? / - He made it obvious
that he's the police earlier.
[Unfair for MINGYU]

874

875
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,099
He spoke as if he knew everything!

875

876
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:12,123
What happens if I die?

876

877
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:14,005
I was certain that it was WOOZI.
[- HOSHI's stance: Why MINGYU is mafia -]

877

878
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,519
But WOOZI died.

878

879
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,119

879

880
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:17,670
It's not me.

880

881
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,650
- Then it's you. / - That reason that it's not you...
[Magical logic] [It's just you, MINGYU]

881

882
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,739
It's not me either.

882

883
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:22,929
But either way, the majority says this,
so you have to die.
[HOSHI and SEUNGKWAN unite
and put MINGYU on the stand]

883

884
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,340
- 1, 2, 3. / - But you did a really good job.
[HOSHI and SEUNGKWAN unite
and put MINGYU on the stand]

884

885
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,309
- You're mafia.
- Good job.

885

886
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:29,159
That's right. I'm mafia.
[MINGYU = mafia]

886

887
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:32,626
Because you were mafia once...
[Always fun to catch the culprit]

887

888
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:34,920
- You were mafia again this time!
- What was really funny earlier was...
[Always fun to catch the culprit]

888

889
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,168
I felt so guilty when you said that.

889

890
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:40,315
You got comfortable because you were mafia
once before, right?
[Scared when VERNON's made that sharp remark]

890

891
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,684
- You said "Oh!" / - He did sort of hesitate.
- What was really funny earlier was that

891

892
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:44,190
WOOZI was the police.
[(((Narrator's stance:

892

893
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,623
- But from the beginning, WOOZI told me mafia.
- In the 1st round. / - He picked in the 1st round.

893

894
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:48,132
So I

894

895
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:48,882
said he was mafia.
[1. Caught mafia from the start]

895

896
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:51,041
But as soon as he woke up,
[1. Caught mafia from the start]

896

897
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,704

898

899

- It was so ridiculous that I said, "These idiots."
- These idiots.
[(Seriously hit with reality)]

899

900
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:00,588
- You figured out who mafia was?
- He found out right away.
- He found out with 1 try.

900

901
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:02,903
- He knew it since the 1st round.
- So it was sort of... I guess

901

902
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:07,581
I took WOOZI's strange energy that

903

904
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:11,615
That's ridiculous!

904

905
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:13,288
You can't package that either.
[(Embarrassed)]

905

906

You're just going to look like

906

907
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:15,523

- Let's play one last round.

[Last round of mafia?]

908

909
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,567
- JEONGHAN...
- Okay, I'll leave after one last round.

909

910

- Do you want to play a round of the liar game?
- Who's going to be the narrator?

910

911
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,210
- I'll be the narrator.
- Okay.

- MINGYU...

01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,725
Once we're there, we have one goal!

1955

1956
01:29:46,725 --> 01:29:48,765
Fighting and winning!

1956

1957
01:29:48,765 --> 01:29:51,795
I hope you all keep that
in mind and arrive safely.
