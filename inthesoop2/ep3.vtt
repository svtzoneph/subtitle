our thoughts keep changing.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.255
But how it changes...
You thought this way at this time,

00:36:09.255 --> 00:36:13.204
but after a situation or incident,
[When you decide something
that was once certain is wrong]

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:15.708
your thought becomes wrong.
[When you decide something
that was once certain is wrong]

00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:18.250
You grow more and more and in life,
[Not failure or despair, but growth]

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.333
your thought
[Not failure or despair, but growth]

00:36:20.358 --> 00:36:21.675
is wrong again.

00:36:21.675 --> 00:36:27.016
Supposedly, we keep looking
until we reach this truth.
[Various thoughts are in some ways
a process of finding truth]

00:36:27.641 --> 00:36:32.697
So older people have their own thing, right?

00:36:32.697 --> 00:36:36.045
- Yes, that's a possibility. / - I might think
"What an oldie" when I hear that when I'm young.
[I thought that]

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.844
Their thoughts too much... I don't live that way.
[Understanding now] [Life's know-hows
coming from the experience of adults]

00:36:39.844 --> 00:36:41.461
But from living,
[Understanding now] [Life's know-hows
coming from the experience of adults]

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:45.409
the majority all think that way a lot.
[Everything comes from life experience]

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.599
We're all the same and those people...
[The realizations after time]

00:36:48.599 --> 00:36:50.945
- Yes, they experience it.
- Because they lived life, they experienced it.
[The realizations after time]

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.719
- That's why nothing adults say is wrong.
- You have to listen.

00:36:54.719 --> 00:36:58.960
At this age now?
I listen to what my mom and dad say.

00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:01.333
- We didn't at all long ago.
- Long ago, not at all.

00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:04.126
Rather than not listening at all,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.567
I thought, "What changed?"
[When he was young,
he couldn't understand his parents]

00:37:06.567 --> 00:37:08.735
- I couldn't feel or accept it. / - You can't accept it.
[When he was young,
he couldn't understand his parents]

00:37:08.735 --> 00:37:12.219
I just thought, "No. This is wrong for me."
[THE 8 was stuck in his own thoughts
and just denied them]

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.771
But now,

00:37:13.784 --> 00:37:17.021
I say, "What do you think, mom?"
Then she tells me.
[Now, he gets help from his parents'
thoughts and experiences]

00:37:17.021 --> 00:37:19.829
Since they also experienced things like this,
[Now, he gets help from his parents'
thoughts and experiences]

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:23.550
they could think this way!
I know that and go my way.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.445
What do you ask your parents?

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:29.592
- Just... relationships.
- Sort of... like relationships.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:32.699
So these days, I practice things like that.

00:37:32.724 --> 00:37:36.059
- What?
- Practicing how to be more thankful.

00:37:36.059 --> 00:37:39.460
How it's done is...
It's sort of like praying.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.237
I just close my eyes and do this.
[(With his hands together)]

00:37:42.237 --> 00:37:43.148
I...

00:37:43.157 --> 00:37:47.148
I'm thankful that I'm even
able to have this nice time at "IN THE SOOP".

00:37:47.148 --> 00:37:51.105
I'm so thankful for DK, who has this time
to converse and be here with me.
["I'm thankful I can converse with DK"]

00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:51.855
Just...
["I'm thankful I can converse with DK"]

00:37:51.855 --> 00:37:53.630
If you have this gratitude,
[If you start (once)]

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.952
the small to big things keep coming to mind.
[(Gratitude does)]

00:37:56.952 --> 00:38:00.875
- I keep saying it until I can't think
of any more. / - That's good.
[Endless gratitude for the big and small things]

00:38:00.875 --> 00:38:03.460
I'm thankful, I'm thankful.
Then there's nothing.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.130
- Then if you open your eyes... / - Then it's a little...
[At the end of your thoughts]

00:38:05.144 --> 00:38:07.666
"I'm living very well!"
[At the end of your thoughts]

00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:09.565
The world also looks very good.

00:38:09.565 --> 00:38:11.277
- If you look, there's a lot to be thankful for.
- It's really...

00:38:11.277 --> 00:38:17.340
It's really interesting that even a moment of
someone passing by and smiling comes to mind.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.472
- You don't even know who it is.
- Even the small things.

00:38:19.472 --> 00:38:21.599
But you're even thankful for that.
[(You have that feeling)]

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.820
Then they keep coming to mind.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.284
Minghao is a thankful person.
[Has he become the icon of gratitude?!]

00:38:25.293 --> 00:38:27.905
I'm thankful that I'm even drinking with you.
[(The tea)]

00:38:33.327 --> 00:38:35.059
What are you going to do after drinking this?

00:38:35.059 --> 00:38:36.505
What should we do?

00:38:36.505 --> 00:38:39.431
Should we take a nap?
You're not sleepy, right?

00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:41.030
I slept so much.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.954
Supposedly, we can ride

00:38:41.954 --> 00:38:45.115
- ATVs toward the observatory.
Let's go. / - Let's go.
[Sudden genre change from

You're not going to drink it?

00:38:50.918 --> 00:38:51.880
I'm not going to drink it.

00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:56.981
- ATVs even made us stop the tea ceremony.
- Of course.
[ATVs even make Mr. Tea Time stop...]

00:38:56.981 --> 00:38:59.675
I still prefer stimulating things like this.
[Stimulating things are needed at times - THE 8 -]

00:38:59.675 --> 00:39:01.996
- How people think...
- You're not going with what's smooth?

We have to live in a stimulating way!
We're young! [(?)]

00:39:14.635 --> 00:39:17.210
It seems like everything
we said up until now

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.759
all became nothing.

No, this is just how it is.
[Emphasizing again]

- I feel like I'm going to die? / - Why?

00:39:45.047 --> 00:39:47.108
Because I drank too much yesterday.
[Someone suffering because of a hangover...]
