00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:25.079
I think I'm good at talking to everyone,

00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:27.819
but the only person I don't really
talk to is S.COUPS.

00:30:28.545 --> 00:30:30.980
There aren't very many times
[DINO wanted to talk to S.COUPS,
the eldest and leader]

00:30:31.002 --> 00:30:33.204
I've talked to Coups.
[DINO wanted to talk to S.COUPS,
the eldest and leader]

00:30:33.204 --> 00:30:34.244
I really...

00:30:34.244 --> 00:30:36.998
I resisted so I could drink here.
[Getting into serious mode]
[With the guys in the forest]

00:30:36.998 --> 00:30:38.758
My joy is...

00:30:38.758 --> 00:30:41.518
drinking with DINO.
[My joy is...] [Can't hold in laughter]

00:30:41.518 --> 00:30:42.978
Why are you like this?

00:30:42.978 --> 00:30:45.184
- Seriously.
- What's gotten into you?

00:30:45.184 --> 00:30:47.930
What do you mean? I'm always like this!
[(Brazen Yoon mode)]

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.914
- This timing is...
- Right?

00:30:50.914 --> 00:30:53.391
- How ridiculous. / - Ssep Ssep!
[The timing...]

00:30:53.391 --> 00:30:54.141
But...

00:30:54.141 --> 00:30:56.640
- How ridiculous.
- But I'm usually ridiculous. Right?
[Self-acclaimed ridiculous guy
on a regular basis (?)]

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.351
Yeah! I'm consistent!
[Self-acclaimed ridiculous guy
on a regular basis (?)]

00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:02.625
- Ssep Ssep! / - Sometimes,
when someone says, "I really like you"

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:04.671
randomly, then it's moving at times.

00:31:04.671 --> 00:31:07.230
But more than it being moving...

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.463
"Is that guy thinking as he speaks...?"

00:31:10.463 --> 00:31:13.457
- "Did he seriously think about it and say that?"
- But DINO...

00:31:13.457 --> 00:31:14.656
If this consistent guy

00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:17.260
is the same at 50,
[Consistent even at 50?]

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.704
then you'll be moved.
[Consistent even at 50?
1004% guaranteed to be moved]

00:31:18.704 --> 00:31:21.953
- But I do think I'll be moved if you're
the same at 50. / - "He's really the same."
[(Admits that)]

00:31:21.953 --> 00:31:24.861
"I feel like I'm looking at the past."
You'll think this.

00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:27.601
- That's true.
- It's like that with any of the 13 members.

00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:28.675
- Of course!
- Right?

00:31:29.675 --> 00:31:31.586
When I'm between the 2 of you...
[S.COUPS' perspective]
[JEONGHAN x DINO = polar opposites (?)]

00:31:31.586 --> 00:31:33.270
You 2 are seriously polar opposites.
[S.COUPS' perspective]
[JEONGHAN x DINO = polar opposites (?)]

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.848
- Why? / - Someone that's very serious and...
[⤣ Very serious youngest]

00:31:34.848 --> 00:31:36.664
Eldest that never stops the joking around.
[Jokester eldest ⤤]

00:31:36.664 --> 00:31:38.435
[Strongly agrees]

00:31:38.435 --> 00:31:39.517
That's right.
[Strongly agrees]

00:31:39.647 --> 00:31:41.201
- That's precise.
- That's right.

00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:42.868
I don't like when things
get serious while drinking.

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:44.082
- Wow, so different.
- You know what I mean, right?

00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:46.648
I don't get serious if people dislike it either.

00:31:46.648 --> 00:31:49.175
No! You do.

00:31:49.175 --> 00:31:50.896
- No, so if people dislike it... / - But you do it.
[(Save... Save me...)]

00:31:50.896 --> 00:31:52.536
- No! / - I don't if that mood isn't created.
[(Save... Save me...)]

00:31:52.536 --> 00:31:53.589
No, you do.

00:31:53.589 --> 00:31:55.905
No, rather than saying
I don't like talking about serious things,

00:31:55.905 --> 00:31:58.961
I don't like talking about serious things
while wanting answers.

00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:00.189
So when you really...

00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:01.737
If you need somewhere to vent
[If you want to vent]

00:32:01.737 --> 00:32:03.884
or need somewhere to talk and
[If you want to vent,
JEONGHAN is always ready to listen]

00:32:03.884 --> 00:32:05.584
talk about serious things, that's totally fine.
[If you want to vent,
JEONGHAN is always ready to listen]

00:32:05.584 --> 00:32:08.076
- Answering... / - What's desired?
[(Having to give an answer)]

00:32:08.076 --> 00:32:11.201
- Should I say I feel pressured to say
what's desired? / - But...

00:32:11.201 --> 00:32:13.221
You're thinking too highly of yourself.

00:32:13.221 --> 00:32:16.241
- No.
- When any of the members talk to you...

00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:17.232
When they talk about serious things with you,

00:32:17.232 --> 00:32:21.846
there's probably nobody looking
for answers from you. [Kekeke]

00:32:21.846 --> 00:32:23.278
I'm right!

00:32:23.278 --> 00:32:24.403
That's why you can do it!
[Actually welcomes it]

00:32:24.403 --> 00:32:26.553
- That's why you do it. / - I do it.
[Actually welcomes it] [(Serious talks with me)]

00:32:26.553 --> 00:32:27.813
- He does it.
- I just...

00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:31.205
I say how I feel. This is just what it is.
[S.COUPS shares his feelings to
JEONGHAN on a regular basis]

00:32:31.205 --> 00:32:33.442
But when you're talking about
serious things or dilemmas,

00:32:33.442 --> 00:32:35.387
- how can anyone but yourself give an answer.
- Yes, that's right.

00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:36.789
I don't think you'd know this.

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:39.762
During the "BE THE SUN" concert opening,
[Can say everything now]
[During the "BE THE SUN" world tour opening]

00:32:39.762 --> 00:32:40.875
We start faced backwards, right?
[Can say everything now]
[During the "BE THE SUN" world tour opening]

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:44.096
But when the stage gradually rises,
the legs show first and

00:32:44.096 --> 00:32:45.992
maybe because he can't see above,
[DINO ⤸] [JEONGHAN ⤸]

00:32:45.992 --> 00:32:46.759
but JEONGHAN...
[DINO ⤸] [JEONGHAN ⤸]

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:49.982
I just look like this and
I try to get into character as much as possible.

00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:51.656
He's in front of me, but he kept...

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.519
- He kept looking like this. / - Why?
[DINO's perspective: Playful JEONGHAN)]

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:55.333
He did this!

00:32:55.347 --> 00:32:57.578
"I can't focus. Why does he keep doing that?"

00:32:57.578 --> 00:32:59.494
But he wouldn't look at me once.

00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:01.410
- He wouldn't because he's trying to focus!
- If he looked at me once,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.548
I'd say "Fighting!" and it would end,
but he would never look at me.

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.076
No!

00:33:04.076 --> 00:33:06.816
- It would break if I looked at you then. / - Okay.
[DINO had a reason for that on stage]

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.820
Then he'll make a mistake.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.015
Yes, that happens often.

00:33:09.015 --> 00:33:14.894
That's why these days,
I was blaming myself a little bit.

00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:17.457
- Now...
- Why are you blaming yourself?

00:33:18.156 --> 00:33:19.973
You blamed yourself?
[Kekeke]

00:33:19.973 --> 00:33:23.143
It never existed in my book.
[Mistake = never existed in DINO's book]

00:33:23.143 --> 00:33:25.103
But you made a lot of mistakes since long ago.
[The guys correct him]
[Mistake = never existed in DINO's book]

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:26.220
It existed in your book.
[The guys correct him]
[Mistake = never existed in DINO's book]

00:33:28.614 --> 00:33:30.555
- You made a lot of mistakes.
You know, right? / - So DINO...

00:33:30.555 --> 00:33:32.864
- I don't know, but...
- You're really good at dancing,

00:33:32.864 --> 00:33:34.776
- but you can't really remember formations.
- You made a lot of mistakes.

00:33:34.776 --> 00:33:36.925
Do you know why?

00:33:36.925 --> 00:33:39.873
He moves as his body leads
absorbed in how cool he feels.
[(The type to get absorbed in his coolness)]

00:33:39.873 --> 00:33:40.623
That's right!

00:33:40.623 --> 00:33:43.574
We move while thinking of
what the next formation is.

00:33:43.574 --> 00:33:44.943
So in our heads, we keep...

00:33:44.943 --> 00:33:46.676
But, DINO.
It's okay.

00:33:46.676 --> 00:33:49.688
The members cover those areas you lack.
[Those areas you lack are okay, DINO]

00:33:49.688 --> 00:33:50.666
So that's why I wear

00:33:50.666 --> 00:33:52.205
both of my in-ears no matter what.
[How DINO solely focuses on the stage]

00:33:52.205 --> 00:33:53.961
I keep the music loud.
[How DINO solely focuses on the stage]

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:56.005
But we lived such busy lives.

00:33:56.005 --> 00:33:58.088
From August to now,

00:33:58.105 --> 00:34:00.808
it feels like a dream.
[Last summer felt like a dream passing by]

00:34:00.808 --> 00:34:02.677
We came to Korea after our US tour, right?
[When they came back to Korea
after the North America tour]

00:34:02.692 --> 00:34:04.862
I got up and

00:34:04.862 --> 00:34:07.056
I thought, "Did I go on the US tour?"

00:34:07.056 --> 00:34:08.675
- I know what you mean! Yes.
- I suddenly become like this.
[Did I go on the US tour...?]

00:34:08.675 --> 00:34:09.724
- That's right!
- It felt like that 1 month

00:34:09.724 --> 00:34:12.681
happened in a dream.
[The tour felt like a midsummer dream]

00:34:14.103 --> 00:34:15.817
But that's nice, too.

00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:20.007
- Then it feels like it ended when you woke up.
- That feeling... That's right! It was like that.

00:34:20.556 --> 00:34:23.976
It's true that we worked hard in life,
but it's also true that we were lucky.

00:34:23.976 --> 00:34:24.880
Of course!

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.684
No, it's just that we were lucky.

00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:29.625
I thought our guys were too good for that.
[Our members are too good to call it luck]

00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:30.889
There are so many people that are good.
[Our members are too good to call it luck]

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.634
No, but nobody is as good as our members.
[A certainty that SEVENTEEN's leader can have]

00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:34.152
- Really? / - Yes, there isn't.
[A certainty that SEVENTEEN's leader can have]

00:34:34.152 --> 00:34:35.012
But...
[A certainty that SEVENTEEN's leader can have]

00:34:35.012 --> 00:34:37.840
These days, something I've been thinking is...

00:34:37.847 --> 00:34:41.572
Being successful and having good timing
may all seem like luck.
[There were opportunities given with luck]

00:34:41.572 --> 00:34:42.322
The only thing

00:34:42.322 --> 00:34:44.675
I don't think has anything to do with luck
[1 thing he's certain wasn't luck]

00:34:44.675 --> 00:34:46.434
is teamwork.
[1 thing he's certain wasn't luck]

00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:48.559
- That's right! You can't call it luck.
- This wasn't luck.

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:49.079
We're still here now like this

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:51.889
because the 13 worked hard.
[Results only made through the members' effort]

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:56.512
In our hearts, SEVENTEEN always came first.
[Made possible because SEVENTEEN
always came first to the 13]

00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:58.686
We did a good job in
SEVENTEEN coming this far.

00:34:59.452 --> 00:35:03.264
I'm curious about something.
[What the youngest DINO
wanted to ask the eldest S.COUPS]

00:35:03.264 --> 00:35:05.039
You spent 8 years as

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:09.849
the eldest of a group. How is it?
[The past 8 years as SEVENTEEN's leader]

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:10.920
Those feelings...

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.003
I'm sad that I'm aging year by year.

00:35:14.275 --> 00:35:15.978
Should I say that I feel a sense of urgency?

00:35:15.978 --> 00:35:19.342
I'm working at this job I chose

00:35:19.342 --> 00:35:23.780
and as I'm working,
I have my own feelings and thoughts, right?

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.547
There were things then that
I wanted to accomplish before turning 30,

00:35:28.547 --> 00:35:33.021
but I feel a sense of urgency
because I haven't accomplished them yet.

00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:36.244
But I let it go a lot this year.

00:35:36.244 --> 00:35:37.963
That was pretty bad last year,

00:35:39.985 --> 00:35:41.313
but this year, it's just...

00:35:41.313 --> 00:35:42.907
It's also been a while since we've toured.
[Sense of urgency disappeared
while busy because of the tour]

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:46.994
That's why those thoughts disappeared a bit.
[Sense of urgency disappeared
while busy because of the tour]

00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:51.081
If I just keep enjoying the present,
[Faith and certainty that good results
will come if he enjoys every moment]

00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:53.777
there will be good results.
[Faith and certainty that good results
will come if he enjoys every moment]

00:35:55.456 --> 00:35:57.177
[(Eye contact with the meat...?)]

00:35:57.177 --> 00:35:58.918
What are you thinking
while looking at the meat?

00:35:59.644 --> 00:36:00.769
That it's really pretty?

00:36:00.769 --> 00:36:02.864
Eye, eye, and mouth.
[⋅⌣⋅]

00:36:02.864 --> 00:36:04.105
It's so cute, right?

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:06.010
That thought is so like you.

00:36:06.023 --> 00:36:10.333
I'm talking about this stuff and
he's thinking, "eye, eye, and mouth."

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:10.961
Cheers!

00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:14.880
[This moment is made possible
because it's with the members]

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.630
It's like JEONGHAN.
[This moment is made possible
because it's with the members]

00:36:17.255 --> 00:36:20.364
I... It's funny to say this, but...
[Sharing his feelings by using this mood]

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:22.539
I have my own friends as well, right?

00:36:22.539 --> 00:36:27.548
My friends in Daegu or
people that I met and talked with a lot.

00:36:27.548 --> 00:36:30.708
Out of them, I think Yoon Jeonghan is the coolest.
[Out of the people I know]

00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:32.179
So what sort of...
[Out of the people I know,
I think Yoon Jeonghan is the coolest]

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:33.373
What's cool is

00:36:33.373 --> 00:36:36.447
that he's consistent and upright.
[Choi Seungcheol sees Yoon Jeonghan
as a consistent and upright person]

00:36:36.447 --> 00:36:39.875
What I'm very thankful for and think is cool
is how he cherishes the team...

00:36:39.875 --> 00:36:42.039
You, me, and everyone probably do...
[(The members)]

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:45.059
I feel like he especially does a lot.

00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:50.262
And how...
I'm in the process of changing,

00:36:50.262 --> 00:36:53.936
but I tend to talk more than listen.
[Unlike S.COUPS, who shares his feelings]

00:36:54.411 --> 00:36:59.021
But I thought his stance of
always listening was cool.
[JEONGHAN always listens to the other person]

00:36:59.047 --> 00:37:01.224
He just seems like a tree that stays there.
["JEONGHAN seems like a still tree
that stays in the spot."]

00:37:01.224 --> 00:37:03.166
Like this.
["JEONGHAN seems like a still tree
that stays in the spot."]

00:37:04.228 --> 00:37:05.320

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.697
That's sort of what I'm dreaming of.

I want to someone like an island.
[JEONGHAN's small hope]

Someone that's just always there?
[JEONGHAN's small hope is
to be someone like an island]

00:37:11.472 --> 00:37:15.373
If someone comes struggling and I accept them
[Being a refuge in tough times where
they can rest comfortably]

00:37:15.373 --> 00:37:20.481
and leaves when they're better,
I'll think, "You'll come again later."
[The desire to bring warmth
with a consistent heart]

00:37:21.056 --> 00:37:25.217

- Really.

- The next solo song should be "Island". / - "Island".
[JEONGHAN's solo title song
as "ISLAND"?! Kekeke]

- I like that!
- "Island" suits you so well.

00:37:36.005 --> 00:37:38.373
It's nice!
But I think it's a good subject.

00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:39.880
It's a good subject.

00:37:41.396 --> 00:37:42.858
I should just make it "Seom" (means "island").
[JEONGHAN is more drawn to
"Seom" than "Island"]

00:37:42.858 --> 00:37:45.101
- "Seom" is nice. / - Yes. "Seom" is good.
[JEONGHAN is more drawn to
"Seom" than "Island"]

00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:46.731
I feel like you'd need to do trot.

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:49.436
- Doesn't it seem like he should do trot?
- No. / - Trot would suit it well.

00:37:53.795 --> 00:37:58.079
- There's someone I really want to do
before the new year as SEVENTEEN.
- What is it?

to go somewhere just once with no cameras.
[A trip with just SEVENTEEN and no cameras]

But DINO really said this since long ago.
[DINO's wish since long ago]

00:38:10.427 --> 00:38:12.657
The last time was when I booked our stay, right?
[DINO's wish since long ago]

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:13.922
- With the managers.
- When was that?

[It's already been 5 years since

But actually, I wanted to go on a trip
with the members this time around, too.

00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:24.641
But...

00:38:24.641 --> 00:38:29.195
Even I couldn't bring up going
together to the members.

It's worth drinking there at least once.
[(At the campground)]

The one that's normally very energetic
is quiet for so long,

I should show any action at all.

is a little burnt out.

for so many things.

and from your perspective,
I'm much younger and that's true,

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:47.139
but from my role,
I was in a position where

00:48:47.139 --> 00:48:52.405
it was harder to comfortably say
when I was struggling.

but I wouldn't admit it myself even if I struggled.
[From a certain point]

my struggling self for the first time.

I didn't have the courage to rest.

it obvious that I was struggling. Because I was.

[Calmly giving a hand of support

I think it was also
very much like that, too.

I didn't want it to show
to the members either.

That I was struggling lately.

You don't have to say thank you.

And when I was also struggling,
you were my support.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.804
You helped me a lot.

taking care of mom."

but she really felt that...

My older sister was also very thankful
while seeing that.

I thought that.

We really don't care about
people we don't like,

in whatever way we can. / - That's right.

- No pressure. Don't be self-conscious.
- I should.

00:53:22.376 --> 00:53:24.137
But I'm seriously so thankful.

00:53:26.293 --> 00:53:28.268
You can be thankful, but it's a given.

00:53:28.268 --> 00:53:30.070
From my perspective, it's a given.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.454
You're just very much my family.

[For now, it's a success...?]

I think I should've done it
on something flat...

The bottom...? All black...?

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.630
Boil some water and put it in.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:39.832

[Pours a bit of water as his mom said]

[While even adjusting the heat level]

01:09:54.283 --> 01:09:56.590
Stir it around in between.

I definitely thought I was
the first one to wake up,

so I was in my bed and showered.
[THE 8 left the sleep zone a bit slowly]

01:11:20.306 --> 01:11:22.712
I came out and thought
I should eat alone,

add sesame oil and seaweed.
[Of course, fried rice is K-dessert!]

That's good, too.

01:11:55.851 --> 01:11:59.395
Should we just make fried rice and leave it?
