but you put it in some more.
[(The marshmallow)]

1336

1337
00:56:41,094 --> 00:56:42,394
It was perfect.

1337

1338
00:56:42,394 --> 00:56:43,601
It was on fire!
[Completely]

Really?

1347

1348
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:00,869
It's going to be kind of hard
because the wind is blowing southwest.

Southwest.

[VERNON searches it right away]

1352

1353

each for two sessions.

- That was really... Man.

"My skills would get better by doing this".

- And if we work really hard like that...

1448

1449
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:44,085
I would have been able to bear it if I had
the certainty that I would debut as SEVENTEEN.

1449

1450
01:00:44,085 --> 01:00:44,835
Of course.

1450

There was a time when I got in trouble for a month.

the punishment for a month was?

1465

1466

You go there first.
I will do the dishes and go.

1579
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,844
- At 3 in the morning... There won't be an idol

- It's really spicy.

1579

Amazing.

Did you bring chopsticks?

Can you get one and give it to me?

1597

1598
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,398
Wait.

Just at this time...

I like that all the members are here!

I know what that is.
