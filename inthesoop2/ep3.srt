750

751

Rather than not listening at all,

751

752
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,567
I thought, "What changed?"

757

758
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:23,550

I know that and go my way.

758

759
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,445
What do you ask your parents?

759

760
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,592
- Just... relationships.
- Sort of... like relationships.

760

761
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,699
