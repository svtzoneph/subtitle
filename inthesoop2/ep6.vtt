00:40:00.402 --> 00:40:01.135
It's you!
[Just because]

00:40:01.135 --> 00:40:03.289
- Yeah, but there should be a reason.
- He's the doctor.

00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:05.925
- Okay. Let's go. It's you. / - It's not me.
[Ganging up on mafia = no particular reason]

00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:08.376
- Why is it me? The doctor should've
saved WOOZI! / - Please raise your thumb.
[Unfair for MINGYU]

00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:09.719
- Why? / - He made it obvious
that he's the police earlier.
[Unfair for MINGYU]

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:11.099
He spoke as if he knew everything!

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:12.123
What happens if I die?

00:40:12.123 --> 00:40:14.005
I was certain that it was WOOZI.
[- HOSHI's stance: Why MINGYU is mafia -]

00:40:14.005 --> 00:40:15.519
But WOOZI died.
[- HOSHI's stance: Why MINGYU is mafia -]

00:40:15.519 --> 00:40:17.119
But I don't think it's you.
[- HOSHI's stance: Why MINGYU is mafia -]

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:17.670
It's not me.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.650
- Then it's you. / - That reason that it's not you...
[Magical logic] [It's just you, MINGYU]

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.739
It's not me either.

00:40:20.739 --> 00:40:22.929
But either way, the majority says this,
so you have to die.
[HOSHI and SEUNGKWAN unite
and put MINGYU on the stand]

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:25.340
- 1, 2, 3. / - But you did a really good job.
[HOSHI and SEUNGKWAN unite
and put MINGYU on the stand]

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.309
- You're mafia.
- Good job.

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:29.159
That's right. I'm mafia.
[MINGYU = mafia]

00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:32.626
Because you were mafia once...
[Always fun to catch the culprit]

00:40:32.626 --> 00:40:34.920
- You were mafia again this time!
- What was really funny earlier was...
[Always fun to catch the culprit]

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.168
I felt so guilty when you said that.

00:40:36.168 --> 00:40:40.315
You got comfortable because you were mafia
once before, right?
[Scared when VERNON's made that sharp remark]

00:40:40.315 --> 00:40:42.684
- You said "Oh!" / - He did sort of hesitate.
- What was really funny earlier was that

00:40:42.684 --> 00:40:44.190
WOOZI was the police.
[(((Narrator's stance:
Police WOOZI's performance)))]

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.623
- But from the beginning, WOOZI told me mafia.
- In the 1st round. / - He picked in the 1st round.
[(((Narrator's stance:
Police WOOZI's performance)))]

00:40:47.623 --> 00:40:48.132
So I

00:40:48.132 --> 00:40:48.882
said he was mafia.
[1. Caught mafia from the start]

00:40:48.882 --> 00:40:51.041
But as soon as he woke up,
[1. Caught mafia from the start]

00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:53.704
everyone picked WOOZI as mafia.
[2. But soon after, they gained up on WOOZI]

00:40:53.704 --> 00:40:54.804
- As I watched...
- As I watched...

00:40:54.804 --> 00:40:57.976
- It was so ridiculous that I said, "These idiots."
- These idiots.
[(Seriously hit with reality)]

00:40:57.976 --> 00:41:00.588
- You figured out who mafia was?
- He found out right away.
- He found out with 1 try.

00:41:00.588 --> 00:41:02.903
- He knew it since the 1st round.
- So it was sort of... I guess

00:41:02.903 --> 00:41:07.581
I took WOOZI's strange energy that
comes out when he's given a role
[The reason he picked WOOZI as mafia]
[Why he picked WOOZI as mafia]

00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:10.215
and isn't even funny as laughter.

00:41:10.215 --> 00:41:11.615
That's ridiculous!

00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:13.288
You can't package that either.
[(Embarrassed)]

00:41:13.288 --> 00:41:14.893
You're just going to look like
you have terrible gut feelings.
[(Embarrassed)]

00:41:14.893 --> 00:41:15.523
Terrible gut feelings?

00:41:15.523 --> 00:41:17.876
- Let's play one last round.
- Are you going to play JEONGHAN?
[Last round of mafia?]

00:41:17.876 --> 00:41:19.567
- JEONGHAN...
- Okay, I'll leave after one last round.

00:41:19.567 --> 00:41:21.045
- Do you want to play a round of the liar game?
- Who's going to be the narrator?

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.210
- I'll be the narrator.
- Okay.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.637
- Here we go. Mafia! / - I don't want to be mafia.
[Narrator of the last round is JEONGHAN]

00:41:24.637 --> 00:41:26.269
I'll pick mafia first.
[Narrator of the last round is JEONGHAN]

00:41:26.269 --> 00:41:27.019
- MINGYU...
- Mafia!

00:41:27.019 --> 00:41:29.639
I'll pick mafia.
[The grand finale of SEVENTEEN'S
"IN THE SOOP 2" ver. mafia]

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:30.804
I'll pick the police!
[The grand finale of SEVENTEEN'S
"IN THE SOOP 2" ver. mafia]

00:41:30.804 --> 00:41:34.364
The police! I'll pick the doctor.
[Who will be the ending fairy mafia?!]

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.315
- Wake up. / - Okay!
[The last mafia game finally begins]

00:41:36.315 --> 00:41:37.250
Day has come.
[The last mafia game finally begins]

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.460
It's so cold.
[The last mafia game finally begins]

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.239
I think JEONGHAN would've picked well.
[(Belatedly waking up)]

00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:42.291
What's up with Boo Seungkwan?
Let's kill him.

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:43.496
What's up with Boo Seungkwan?

00:41:43.521 --> 00:41:45.253
Let's kill him.

00:41:45.677 --> 00:41:47.268
Why didn't you wake up?

00:41:47.268 --> 00:41:48.740
Hello! I'm Reporter Ju.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.527
[Look at that rhyme]

00:41:51.527 --> 00:41:53.536
- I'm being cornered.
- He's so good!

00:41:53.585 --> 00:41:57.307
- It's so unfair. I don't think I can do it.
- "Let's kill him." "Hello, I'm Reporter Ju."

00:41:57.813 --> 00:42:00.340
Reporter Ju is seriously...
[Number 1 at escaping danger with his wits]

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.869
The reason I woke up late is...
[Number 1 at escaping danger with his wits]

00:42:01.869 --> 00:42:02.951
- Look at that witty ad-lib.
- He's fast!

00:42:02.951 --> 00:42:06.155
While I've been here...
[(Suddenly a mono-documentary)]

00:42:07.032 --> 00:42:09.014
- Let's kill him.
- He has something else.

00:42:09.014 --> 00:42:10.905
- Let's kill him. / - He's really
the police or doctor this time.
- Yeah, there's something.

00:42:10.905 --> 00:42:13.195
- There's something that can look cool
again this time. / - Something is important.

00:42:13.195 --> 00:42:14.903
- Something is important. / - He sort of...
[Kekeke]

00:42:14.903 --> 00:42:16.028
There's something he can accomplish.

00:42:16.028 --> 00:42:16.981
- No!
- But he's not the police.

00:42:16.981 --> 00:42:20.690
- Because... / - I was like this
earlier as well, but I wasn't anything.
[I'm in serious mode right now]

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:21.940
I'm just saying this.
[I'm in serious mode right now]

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.621
Wow, DINO...

00:42:23.621 --> 00:42:25.329
Yes, around when I got up...

00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:29.706
- Around this time... It's about time he got it.
- DINO... It's time that DINO does it.
I got that feeling.
[It's about time that DINO is mafia now]

00:42:29.706 --> 00:42:31.356
- From his eyes.
- But...

00:42:31.356 --> 00:42:34.016
Isn't it meaningless to say that
it's about time we do it now?
[But blaming the timing is meaningless]

00:42:34.141 --> 00:42:35.980
That's right. It's meaningless.
[But blaming the timing is meaningless]

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.820
Since we can't keep twisting it.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.530
- I always died because of that. / - Yeah.
[(Timing victim 1)]

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.184
"It's time for WOOZI to do it."
[(Timing victim 1)]

00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:43.340
- But it's really time that it's WOOZI.
- What are you talking about!

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.061
Always!

00:42:45.576 --> 00:42:48.384
- But this time, it's for real.
- But it really is time for you to do it.

00:42:48.384 --> 00:42:50.115
It's for real this time.
[(Certain VERNON)]

00:42:50.115 --> 00:42:52.262
It's about time!

00:42:52.262 --> 00:42:55.012
- Oh! That was sort of convincing.
- It's for real this time.
[Kekekekeke]

00:42:55.224 --> 00:42:58.539
- Because it's the last round! / - For real!
[Agrees with VERNON's logical persuasion]

00:42:58.539 --> 00:43:02.347
- It's for real this time. / - These idiots!
[(Shakes head)]

00:43:02.347 --> 00:43:04.289
But I really think it's SEUNGKWAN.

00:43:04.289 --> 00:43:05.739
I want to pick SEUNGKWAN once, too.
[Suddenly cornering in on SEUNGKWAN]

00:43:05.739 --> 00:43:07.565
- SEUNGKWAN.
- Yes, let's pick SEUNGKWAN.
[Suddenly cornering in on SEUNGKWAN]

00:43:07.764 --> 00:43:09.400
Raise them, everyone!

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.175
SEUNGKWAN! Do you have anything to say?
[- SEUNGKWAN's final defense -]

00:43:11.175 --> 00:43:12.702
JEONGHAN...

00:43:12.702 --> 00:43:15.746
- He wouldn't give me anything. / - But I don't
think he would've picked SEUNGKWAN.
[Reason why SEUNGKWAN is a civilian (?)]

00:43:15.746 --> 00:43:18.856
- What do you mean! / - It's really true.
I can relate so much. / - He was upset!

00:43:18.856 --> 00:43:20.257
No, I could relate.

00:43:20.257 --> 00:43:22.503
- But I don't think it's SEUNGKWAN.
- Just this... That's right.

00:43:22.503 --> 00:43:24.335
My gut feeling is...
[HOSHI's gut feeling is]

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:25.369
- It's DINO. / - Let's go with DINO.
[HOSHI's gut feeling is still DINO]

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.360
- I pick DINO, too. Really. / - Yeah.
[DK also suspects DINO as mafia]

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.795
I also thought he would give me a role,

00:43:29.795 --> 00:43:30.804
but I'm just...

00:43:30.804 --> 00:43:32.135
Right now, I'm a real civilian.

00:43:32.135 --> 00:43:34.000
Everyone... Civilian... They're all that.
[(Sick of this civilian repertoire)]

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.507
- Okay! Then kill me! / - Okay. Since we have
to kill anybody in the first round now.
[⤣ Voluntary tax payment (?)]

00:43:36.507 --> 00:43:37.342
- Are we going? / - Kill you?
[⤣ Voluntary tax payment (?)]

00:43:37.342 --> 00:43:38.934
- Then kill SEUNGKWAN.
- Do you pick DINO or SEUNGKWAN?
[SEUNGKWAN sounds good!]

00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:39.818
Then let's kill SEUNGKWAN then.
[SEUNGKWAN sounds good]

00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:40.380
Let's kill SEUNGKWAN

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.784
- and then kill DINO. / - Okay.
[The next one is DINO]

00:43:41.784 --> 00:43:42.969
Killing SEUNGKWAN also sounds good.
[The next one is DINO]

00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:44.208
1, 2, 3!

00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:46.344
What's the meaning of this!
[Unanimously SEUNGKWAN]

00:43:46.344 --> 00:43:48.844
An innocent civilian has died.
[Innocent civilian SEUNGKWAN is OUT]

00:43:48.844 --> 00:43:50.829
Look down, everyone.

00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:52.219
I think it's more fun knowing and watching.

00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:54.554
Please wake up and save someone first.

00:43:55.045 --> 00:43:56.550
Oh, that's nice.
[Doctor HOSHI]

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.027

and check someone.
[Interesting]
[Time for the police to check for mafia]

Mafia, please wake up and kill someone.
[Mafia also picks after]

00:44:11.764 --> 00:44:13.498
Yes, please wake up.

- Then who is... / - These 5.
[Currently WOOZI, MINGYU,
DK, VERNON, and DINO are alive]

- Wow! I got a feeling!
- Who is it?

00:44:31.835 --> 00:44:32.871
It's VERNON.

00:44:32.871 --> 00:44:35.045
[(Strong denial)]

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.445
He has denied it strongly.
[Hahaha]

00:44:39.445 --> 00:44:41.659
Thinking about this intently is meaningless.
[Reasoning is meaningless with mafia]

00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:42.769
You wouldn't be it 3 times, right?
[It wouldn't be MINGYU, right?]

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.719
- Seriously not 3 times! Not 3 times.
- Not 3 times, right?
[It wouldn't be MINGYU, right?]

00:44:44.719 --> 00:44:47.282
Wow, but it would be amazing if it was WOOZI.

00:44:47.282 --> 00:44:51.061
- On the outside, WOOZI sort of looks
like a detective right now. / - His fashion...
His fashion makes him look like a detective.

00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:54.664
He's in the violent crimes division.
[WOOZI / District Chief Investigator]

00:44:54.664 --> 00:44:55.869
Who are you? Who...

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:58.315
I'm not sure out of the 5 right now.

00:44:58.315 --> 00:45:00.429
- Out of those, DINO... / - I see.
[MINGYU is suspicious of DINO]

00:45:00.429 --> 00:45:01.235
This guy has a job.

00:45:01.235 --> 00:45:02.851
- It's still DINO for me. / - I don't have a job.
[DK was suspicious of DINO from the start]

00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:05.014
- Do you not have a job?
- It's still DINO for me.
[DK was suspicious of DINO from the start]

00:45:05.014 --> 00:45:07.760
"DINO"?
It doesn't matter if you kill me though.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.360
Then die!

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.860
It does matter.
[You have to listen to
what people say until the end]

00:45:11.393 --> 00:45:15.760
But I... How should I say this?
It's a good thing to leave a lot of civilians.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.440
- Let's kill DINO first. Let's do it quickly.
- We'll go with DINO. / - Hold on!

Who do you think it is, WOOZI?

00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:21.460
I think it's MINGYU, but...

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.068
Would he really do it a 3rd time?

00:45:24.219 --> 00:45:25.677
- I think it's DK. / - It's really not me.
[Thoughts are all divided]

00:45:25.677 --> 00:45:27.003
- That's why I'm torn. / - I really...
[Thoughts are all divided]
