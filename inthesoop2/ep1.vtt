[Q. It seems like you've gotten busier lately.]

00:27:56.866 --> 00:28:00.317
There were overlapping promotions that
required a lot of energy that.

00:28:00.317 --> 00:28:03.237
There was the full length album
and repackaged album.

00:28:03.237 --> 00:28:07.352
In between, we had various schedules.
[(The world tour)]

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.146

[International schedules continue endlessly]

and we're going on tour the day after tomorrow.
[International schedules continue endlessly]

00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:14.278
We actually said that the most.

00:28:14.278 --> 00:28:17.522
Is it right for us to go at this time?
[Is it right to go to "IN THE SOOP 2"
amidst the busy schedules?]

[Having to leave in the busy schedule of

[There was also anxiety]

00:28:30.929 --> 00:28:35.019
But it would be nice to go if we had time.
["But it would be nice to go again."]

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:39.650
I think I'll just lay everything down
and be able to truly rest this time.

00:28:39.724 --> 00:28:43.310
Either way, we'll work even when we rest.

00:28:43.644 --> 00:28:48.394
I have the mindset that we should
totally rest when we rest.
["IN THE SOOP" taught them that
rest is necessary for the leap ahead]

It's hot!

00:29:04.186 --> 00:29:05.729

What are they do?

- Struggles are a given thing.
- It's okay to struggle.

01:02:17.188 --> 01:02:18.682
It's okay to struggle.

01:02:18.682 --> 01:02:20.175
Of course you might struggle!

01:02:20.175 --> 01:02:26.005
Just as we're happy sometimes,
we also struggle sometimes.

01:02:26.005 --> 01:02:28.503
But there are actually more struggles.

01:02:28.827 --> 01:02:31.155
- Isn't it a struggle half the time for everyone?
- That's right.

01:02:31.155 --> 01:02:34.119
No, but as I'm struggling, I'm happy.

01:02:34.119 --> 01:02:37.389
- As I'm struggling, I'm really happy.
- Then that's good.

01:02:37.389 --> 01:02:42.500
I think it's a relief that I'm in a place like this
and I can feel happiness

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.170
on my own while looking at nature.
[Relieved that he can feel happy in nature]

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:49.530
You still feel it.
[Relieved that he can feel happy in nature]

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:54.594
- I know how to feel it and how to like it,
so I think it's a relief. / - That's right.

01:02:54.594 --> 01:02:57.054
That's how much of a detailed side I have.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:58.309
- Myself... / - That's right.
[But at times, those emotions collide
and there's sensitivity]

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.349
- So even with trivial emotions... / - We feel them.
[But at times, those emotions collide
and there's sensitivity]

01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:02.974
I keep feeling them.
[But at times, those emotions collide
and there's sensitivity]

01:03:02.974 --> 01:03:08.085
I also used to have
a very sensitive personality, right?

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:09.960
I really hated it for a while.
[(My personality)]

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.425
Yourself?

01:03:11.425 --> 01:03:15.360
People were so cautious of me.
[THE 8's past comes to mind when
looking at SEUNGKWAN now]

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.534
- Well... / - When I did something...
[THE 8's past comes to mind when
looking at SEUNGKWAN now]

01:03:16.534 --> 01:03:18.768
I actually still think that way.

01:03:18.768 --> 01:03:20.367
- Me too. Yes.
- If there's one thing,

01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:21.342
it's one after another.

01:03:21.342 --> 01:03:23.085
- It's one after another. / - It's one after another.
[Countless thoughts with no conclusion]

01:03:23.085 --> 01:03:25.347
And there's no conclusion.
[Countless thoughts with no conclusion
with one after another]

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:27.275
You just keep thinking.
[Countless thoughts with no conclusion
with one after another]

01:03:27.795 --> 01:03:32.735
But now, I think my personality
has improved a lot because

01:03:32.735 --> 01:03:36.074
I can feel more emotions
that others can't feel.

01:03:36.224 --> 01:03:37.474
- That's a huge advantage for us.
- And...

01:03:37.474 --> 01:03:38.766
And as an artist,

01:03:38.766 --> 01:03:41.289
those emotions
[Rather than hiding the emotions]

01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:44.032
can be made more artistic and
[Rather than hiding the emotions,
trying to express them in a positive way]

01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:47.438
you can make something related to our jobs.
[Rather than hiding the emotions,
trying to express them in a positive way]

01:03:47.438 --> 01:03:51.934
I feel like I've become someone who can share
these emotions to more people, too.
[Rather than hiding the emotions,
trying to express them in a positive way]

01:03:51.934 --> 01:03:52.880
That's right.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.945
- That's right.
- It's just one thing. It's just...

01:03:54.945 --> 01:03:58.635
I can feel a lot of emotions.
[Being devoted to the many emotions felt lately]

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:02.527
I'm very devoted these days.
[Being devoted to the many emotions felt lately]

01:04:08.619 --> 01:04:14.875
But the job of being an idol like us...
I think there's something like that.

01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:18.429
- The anxiety felt during breaks.
When we rest, it's sort of... - That's right.

01:04:18.429 --> 01:04:19.858
We have to do self care
and exercise.
[Self care is constant also during breaks]

01:04:19.858 --> 01:04:23.623
- We have to work out.
- We have to do things related to our jobs...
[Self care is constant also during breaks]

01:04:23.623 --> 01:04:25.309
Of course, that mindset it good.
[Self care is constant also during breaks]

01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:28.750
But you also need to feel relaxed

01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:31.179
- so that you can do
- That's right.

01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:34.050
- a better job at this job.
- And you end up loving it.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.449
And these days, I'm really like that.

01:04:36.449 --> 01:04:40.440
During our world tour 3 years ago,
I had a very hard time.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.159
My skill of feeling things was very poor.
[THE 8 reached his limits during
the world tour 3 years ago]

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:48.199
We always do the same stages on tour.
[THE 8 reached his limits during
the world tour 3 years ago]

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:52.804
But now, I still struggle physically,
[The current world tour schedules
is physically tiring just the same]

01:04:52.804 --> 01:04:55.072
but mentally,
[While completely feeling the love]

01:04:55.072 --> 01:04:56.652
the fact that I'm receiving love...
[While completely feeling the love,
THE 8 feels relaxed]

01:04:56.652 --> 01:04:59.853
- Now that I'm relaxed on the inside. / - Yes.
[While completely feeling the love,
THE 8 feels relaxed]

01:04:59.853 --> 01:05:04.144
These days, I can even feel
the love we receive from fans.
[These days, I can even feel the love we receive from CARAT.]

01:05:04.144 --> 01:05:06.244
I sort of feel it.
[Just do]

01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:09.657
- It's sort of just so... It's so nice!
- I was like that recently, too.

01:05:10.268 --> 01:05:15.070
So these days, I feel very relaxed.

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:18.010
The sense of urgency I used to feel disappeared.
[(That was there)]

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.119
Relationships became very comfortable.
[As he felt relaxed]

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:24.110
With everyone...
[As he felt relaxed, relationships became natural]

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:27.510
What about me?
How someone else sees me?

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:30.070
I'm curious how others also see me.
[SEUNGKWAN is curious how others see him]

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:32.144
When I look at you...
[SEUNGKWAN is curious how others see him]

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.077
Even if it's not about troubles (issues).

01:05:36.117 --> 01:05:38.704
Whether I look sensitive...

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.525
But being sensitive isn't a bad thing.

01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:45.184
I think it's a good thing.
When I think about it now,
being sensitive is a good thing.

01:05:45.184 --> 01:05:46.625
- Really...
- If it's used well.

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:51.465
Because if you're not sensitive...
If you don't go deep...

01:05:51.465 --> 01:05:55.085
We can check more good and new emotions.
[Being sensitive means they have
the skill to feel and express various emotions]

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:55.835
That's right.
[Being sensitive means they have
the skill to feel and express various emotions]

01:05:55.835 --> 01:05:58.835
We have the skill to feel more.
[Being sensitive means they have
the skill to feel and express various emotions]

01:05:58.835 --> 01:06:00.704
I think it's such a good thing.
[Being sensitive means they have
the skill to feel and express various emotions]

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.280
And even with expression...

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:07.454
- That's right. / - It's much better than someone
that's not sensitive. You're deeper.

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:08.840
What you feel is different.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.054
You need to feel in this world
to live a more fun life.

01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:16.809
But since we're not living alone,

01:06:16.809 --> 01:06:18.119
when others see me...
[SEUNGKWAN is worried he'll harm others
with his thought and heart]

01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:21.119
I can't do that while harming others.
[SEUNGKWAN is worried he'll harm others
with his thought and heart]

01:06:21.119 --> 01:06:22.019
But I...
[SEUNGKWAN is worried he'll harm others
with his thought and heart]

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:25.619
But I think that sort of harm is okay.

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:32.239
Either way, as long as you don't
intentionally try to harm others, it's okay.

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:39.070
And at the end of the day,
hurting others

01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:43.293
makes you feel the worst.

01:06:43.293 --> 01:06:45.835
Even if you do that, you'll regret it afterwards.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.250
"I shouldn't be like this."

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:51.413
- Yes, then I learn. / - Yes.
[An encouragement that being as he is
right now is plenty enough]

01:06:51.664 --> 01:06:56.164
I think I was trained too much on

01:06:56.164 --> 01:06:59.315
how others might see me.
Especially when I was a trainee.

01:06:59.764 --> 01:07:02.650
I wasn't like this when I was young.

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:05.625
I used to goof off wherever I went.

01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:08.219
As I became a trainee, I sort of...
[Evaluations became a given as a trainee]

01:07:08.219 --> 01:07:09.469
"That doesn't look cool."
[Evaluations became a given as a trainee]

01:07:09.469 --> 01:07:11.978
"Why are you doing that? It's so weird."
[Evaluations became a given as a trainee]

01:07:11.978 --> 01:07:13.581
I heard this so much.
[Evaluations became a given as a trainee]

01:07:13.581 --> 01:07:16.255
So the way others saw me
became the standard.

01:07:16.275 --> 01:07:20.103
I thought a lot about how others
will see me if I do something.

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:23.208
- That's a little unfortunate...
- That's really...

01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:25.340
But it's sort of...
But I...

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:29.594
If others like what they see of me,
[How others see him became
the standard of happiness]

01:07:29.594 --> 01:07:31.170
Isn't that enough?
[How others see him became
the standard of happiness]

01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:33.594
I also feel like that makes me happy.
[How others see him became
the standard of happiness]

01:07:33.594 --> 01:07:35.690
- Even now? / - What others like of me
[How others see him became
the standard of happiness]

01:07:35.989 --> 01:07:38.534
also became what I like.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:42.050
But that doesn't mean
I'm distinctly subjective.

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:43.626
But with what I do...

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.213
Whether it's over a cover song or what I want,
[I have certainty of what I'm good at]

01:07:46.213 --> 01:07:48.063
I really have certainty about myself.
[I have certainty of what I'm good at]

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:51.014
We need to go out on this to be successful.
[I have certainty of what I'm good at]

01:07:51.014 --> 01:07:53.213
If we go out on this, reactions will be amazing.
[I have certainty of what I'm good at]

01:07:53.213 --> 01:07:54.713
I have certainty about myself,

01:07:54.713 --> 01:07:58.561
but I feel like I lack the eye for photos
[Scared and worried about what he lacks]

01:07:58.561 --> 01:07:59.960
- compared to others. / - That's...
[Scared and worried about what he lacks]

01:07:59.972 --> 01:08:03.335
To me, that's completely irrelevant.
[Scared and worried about what he lacks]

01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:04.135
It was to

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:06.943
look good for the fans and public or
[Having a good influence on CARAT is a given]

01:08:06.943 --> 01:08:09.583
give good energy, right?
[Having a good influence on CARAT is a given]

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:11.800
You don't need to think of that too much.
[Having a good influence on CARAT is a given]

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.614
- This is a given... / - It's a given.
[Having a good influence on CARAT is a given]

01:08:13.664 --> 01:08:16.293
It's right to do what others would like.
[Having a good influence on CARAT is a given]

01:08:16.293 --> 01:08:18.012
Either way, that's also to show myself.

01:08:18.012 --> 01:08:20.766
Things like In*tagram aren't
based on my standards either.

01:08:20.766 --> 01:08:25.911
If you really don't want to go off
others' standards, don't post anything.

01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:28.989
But when you do this,

01:08:28.989 --> 01:08:30.109
they'll like it.
[On the other hand, actions to be accepted]

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:34.085
"I have to do this to be accepted by this person."
[On the other hand, actions to be accepted]

01:08:34.085 --> 01:08:36.055
I think that's totally...
[On the other hand, actions to be accepted]

01:08:36.354 --> 01:08:40.045
I think that will give you a hard time.
[Things that give you a hard time]

01:08:40.045 --> 01:08:42.634
Because if you do things on your standards
[Things that give you a hard time]

01:08:42.634 --> 01:08:47.091
and make it so you accept them,
why do you need more acceptance from others?

01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:51.083
Or if I'm not good at something,
I accept it

01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:55.255
and I would just receive
help from others with that.

01:08:55.255 --> 01:08:57.265
Then I would feel more at ease.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:09:01.498
- "Why do I go by others' standards?"
You won't think this anymore. / - That's right.

01:09:01.498 --> 01:09:04.069
That's why you also have to accept
what you are not good at.

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:05.972
It's not that I picked this!

01:09:05.972 --> 01:09:08.297
- People who will see good things about me
are looking at me. / - That's right!

01:09:08.297 --> 01:09:11.599
I can think of it that way,
but I'm so easily convinced.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.935
Do I get too swayed?
[Has been swayed by others' perspectives]

01:09:14.409 --> 01:09:16.404
"I can't pick this on my own?"
[Has been swayed by others' perspectives]

01:09:16.404 --> 01:09:18.140
I sort of become like this. At the time.
[Has been swayed by others' perspectives]

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.135
That's a given.
[Has been swayed by others' perspectives]

01:09:20.135 --> 01:09:25.569
And we...
We're very mannerly people.

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:28.413
We have very mannered personalities,

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.329
so if we behave based off our standards,

01:09:31.329 --> 01:09:34.520
we can't do anything others will hate.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.850
- That's right. Basically...
- Yes, basically...

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:40.073
- We... / - Because we're not bad people...
[We grew up more mannered than others]

01:09:40.073 --> 01:09:41.743
Fundamentally, we are courteous,
[We grew up more mannered than others]

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:43.640
so we...

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.739
That's a great comment.

01:09:44.739 --> 01:09:50.382
So if you have your standards
and accept yourself, [And act]

01:09:50.382 --> 01:09:55.382
will we ever behave in a way
that others will see negatively?

01:09:55.382 --> 01:09:59.188
We don't want to live like that,
so how could we?

01:09:59.188 --> 01:10:00.604
That's right.

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:07.500
Just recognize that.
[That thought alone begins small transformation]

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:12.109
- It's very hard to change. / - That's right.
[That thought alone begins small transformation]

01:10:12.109 --> 01:10:14.864
But you have to know how to think that way.

01:10:14.864 --> 01:10:16.954
So it's very important to know yourself.

01:10:16.954 --> 01:10:18.885
- That's right.
- Even with myself,

01:10:18.885 --> 01:10:21.744
I thought I cared about how others saw me.

I knew because you told me.
[Learning about myself through conversation]

It's not that I care about others,

but that it was given.

That's right. That's a given!

01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:37.564
I might make a lot of decisions with certainty
in myself more than I care what others think,

01:10:37.564 --> 01:10:39.104
but I didn't know that now and

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:41.650
- I found out through talking with you now.
- You found out?

01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:45.324
I'm sorry, but you're gradually...
I feel like your body is going in deeper!

This isn't done while seeing.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.957

Done! I'll stop here.

01:11:10.045 --> 01:11:11.710

Okay. I'm going to fish all day
starting tomorrow morning.
[Reserving morning fishing tomorrow again]

Should we take a photo of each other?

[The first night of "IN THE SOOP 2" has come]

We'll probably gain about 3 kg
after "IN THE SOOP" ends, right?

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.871
I have to maintain it well
while at "IN THE SOOP".
