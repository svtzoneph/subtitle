WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:07.591
[staff] Throughout the 10-year journey,

00:07.674 --> 00:10.177
what has been the driving force
for SEVENTEEN?

00:10.260 --> 00:11.470
The driving force?

00:11.553 --> 00:13.263
There really are...

00:15.265 --> 00:16.725
[sighs] too many to mention.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.227
[♪ enthralling music playing]

00:18.810 --> 00:20.437
We fight sometimes. We talk a lot.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.105
I think that's very important.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.233
I think it's our wish to bring joy

00:24.316 --> 00:26.818
to those who love us.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.908
I think my own values have been
the driving force behind my hard work.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.952
Do I need to say more?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.623
Being away from them helps. [chuckles]

00:43.585 --> 00:46.296
Don't even get me started with the CARATs.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.799
It's a wonderful career,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.384
and I'm enjoying every moment.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.052
For me.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.029
Well, first of all,

01:12.531 --> 01:13.615
I actually...

01:21.623 --> 01:25.711
AS SEVENTEEN NEARS THEIR 10TH ANNIVERSARY,
THEY PREPARE THEIR FIFTH STUDIO ALBUM

01:25.794 --> 01:28.714
We've already achieved a lot of our goals,

01:28.797 --> 01:35.053
now our goal is to enjoy
and sustain everything steadily.

01:35.137 --> 01:38.473
The short-term goal
is to finish the studio album well.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.560
We need to discuss

01:41.643 --> 01:44.229
the release date
of the 10th anniversary album,

01:44.313 --> 01:46.732
the preparation, and other related plans.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.817
[♪ tense music playing]

01:49.693 --> 01:52.863
We did say we wanted
the album to drop on May 26th,

01:52.946 --> 01:54.948
but the timeline is a bit tight.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.703
[staff] Postponing the album
lessens its meaning.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.996
It does lose its meaning.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.539
Since the timeline is so tight,

02:02.622 --> 02:05.375
the production team
wants to postpone the schedule

02:06.084 --> 02:12.090
and start the album promotion on May 26th.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.552
But we want to drop it
on our 10th anniversary

02:15.636 --> 02:17.387
even if it means pushing ourselves.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.683
For now, I don't want
to look too far ahead.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.479
I want to focus on creating this album
with all 13 members.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.522
After the studio album,

02:27.606 --> 02:30.192
I hope to enjoy SEVENTEEN's new

02:30.275 --> 02:32.486
and slightly different tour experience.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.488
I actually think
going with "Birthday" straightforwardly

02:34.571 --> 02:35.697
-isn't bad.
-Me too.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.032
[BUMZU] You mean for the keyword?

02:37.115 --> 02:39.117
[HOSHI] That's not bad.
And then with parentheses...

02:39.201 --> 02:42.579
If you want to convey
that kind of idea as well...

02:42.663 --> 02:44.414
[BUMZU] Then, "0526" in the parentheses.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.957
-"0526"?
-"Birthday" is too common.

02:46.041 --> 02:50.337
I disagree because
this keyword is so common.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.089
[WOOZI] I mean, keywords come and go

02:52.172 --> 02:54.091
-as we proceed.
-True.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.928
[WOOZI] We had been working on
potential title tracks

02:58.011 --> 03:00.847
and had already failed a few times.

03:00.931 --> 03:05.268
I wish we could take the word "Birthday"
and give it a twist.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.978
-[SEUNGKWAN] Me too.
-[VERNON] Just a little bit.

03:07.062 --> 03:10.273
I think when you hear the word "Birthday,"

03:10.357 --> 03:12.734
-it feels a bit too frilly.
-[MINGYU] Cut the umbilical cord...

03:12.818 --> 03:14.111
When you hear the word "Birthday,"

03:14.194 --> 03:15.654
-it could either feel hip...
-[VERNON] Yes.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.656
...or it could feel frilly.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.866
That's what I think.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.326
-It would work if we make it hip.
-Yes.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.162
Considering the song's tempo
and other elements,

03:24.246 --> 03:26.039
the genre would be closer to EDM.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.708
-[MINGYU] But "Birthday" doesn't...
-It would hit like this.

03:29.459 --> 03:33.713
-[VERNON] That's not bad.
-It depends on the music and lyrics.

03:33.797 --> 03:38.468
It was our 10th anniversary album,
so everyone pitched in their ideas.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.305
We really went over each song, the themes,

03:42.389 --> 03:46.435
the album cover, and the music videos.

03:46.518 --> 03:50.272
Every component was reviewed with care.

03:50.355 --> 03:56.570
Every album took a lot of work,
but we truly put our hearts into this one.

03:56.653 --> 04:00.198
Let's move on to the solo tracks.

04:00.282 --> 04:04.619
In short, this album is trying to convey
a kind of rebirth, right?

04:05.203 --> 04:07.289
As if shedding old skin and being reborn.

04:07.372 --> 04:11.334
We can tie all the songs together
by having the theme be about "me."

04:11.835 --> 04:13.670
To explore that theme,
it could be about your past,

04:13.753 --> 04:17.174
present, or future selves.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.759
-But I don't think that matters.
-"Just me."

04:19.843 --> 04:23.013
You are free to express "me" in any form.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.766
And then, the "rebirth" concept

04:25.849 --> 04:28.477
can be expressed through the group song.

04:29.227 --> 04:33.356
This is the 10th album,
so if it's possible, we should be more...

04:33.440 --> 04:36.735
When we create an album,
we think about its story,

04:36.818 --> 04:42.115
the messages in the photos,
and the story told by the music videos.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.367
All of these elements come together

04:44.451 --> 04:46.703
to tell a story like a great film.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.996
That's why

04:48.079 --> 04:50.081
working on the story and the messages

04:50.165 --> 04:52.793
is the most important step.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.837
It's the 10th anniversary album.
Let's give it our all.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.507
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

04:59.007 --> 05:02.511
Even after 10 years
and five studio albums,

05:02.594 --> 05:06.223
we keep pushing forward

05:06.306 --> 05:09.059
and striving to improve.

05:09.142 --> 05:14.272
That's the kind of team we are,
and that's the message we want to convey.

05:14.356 --> 05:19.903
So we decided to lean into
the birthday party concept.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.990
With "HIT," we wanted to break everything.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.535
And with "Super," we tried so hard...

05:27.077 --> 05:28.662
-[HOSHI] To rise through the ranks.
-Right.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.039
We pushed ourselves
to rise through the ranks.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.333
But we don't have the same goal
as back then.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.669
-[HOSHI] True.
-Our vibe is not the same.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.797
To be honest,
this is our current team vibe.

05:39.756 --> 05:45.178
"What can we work harder on?"

05:45.846 --> 05:47.514
In any case, we must try our best.

05:47.597 --> 05:51.142
I will be coming into the studio
during the break,

05:51.226 --> 05:53.478
so I will have something worked on.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.981
Now we have to work with 11 members,

05:56.064 --> 06:01.111
which raised some concerns.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.446
WOOZI had also been
thinking a lot about that.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.782
This album was made by all 13 members

06:05.866 --> 06:08.869
before the absences occurred.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.162
After the fifth studio album,

06:11.663 --> 06:15.166
we all knew it might take a while
for SEVENTEEN to be complete again.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.003
[♪ SEVENTEEN "HBD" playing]

06:20.046 --> 06:22.215
This 10th anniversary album

06:22.299 --> 06:24.843
was a huge challenge for us too.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.344
It's also a big milestone.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.723
Since this studio album
marks our 10th anniversary,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.266
we put in a lot of work.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.727
It started with the intention

06:33.810 --> 06:38.732
of everyone turning a new leaf
and embracing a fresh start.

06:38.815 --> 06:43.028
I think this album took many risks
and feels quite daring.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.488
It is a concept
SEVENTEEN usually doesn't attempt.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.365
[WONWOO] This could be the starting point

06:47.449 --> 06:49.284
for our next step.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.536
[WOOZI] We don't want to fall behind.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.721
That's why I like it.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.723
Originally, "HBD" was the title track.

At the time, Jihoon was worn out
from writing so many songs.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.856
But he suddenly got inspired
and wrote "Thunder."

08:01.940 --> 08:04.901
We had never done a title track like this.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.611
Of course, I understand that

08:06.695 --> 08:09.489
aligning the title track
to the album concept is essential.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.366

08:11.449 --> 08:15.203
If we want to prioritize
the album's concept,

08:15.286 --> 08:17.288
then "HBD" is the right choice.

08:17.372 --> 08:22.043
I love "Thunder" because
I love songs that tell a personal story.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.087
-[BUMZU] Right.
-A story that's not embellished.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.547
When they sing it,

08:25.630 --> 08:28.466
it just feels completely natural
coming from them.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.010
That's why I liked "Thunder" so much.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.888
Just as I was feeling completely stuck,

08:33.972 --> 08:36.141
inspiration hit me.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.309
It hit me like a thunder.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.853
That is just so SEVENTEEN.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.063
Because it is our 10th anniversary,

08:42.147 --> 08:44.858
I thought we could make it work.

08:44.941 --> 08:49.988
Maybe we could use "Thunder" to show
that SEVENTEEN has a lot more to offer.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.283
I understand
where you're coming from, BUMZU.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.870
Musically, I felt more confident
in "Thunder" than in "HBD,"

08:56.953 --> 08:59.122
which is why I said I like "Thunder."

08:59.205 --> 09:02.000
But what matters most
is how the members feel about it.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.588
If they can have fun with it,
it'll be the song that shines.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.549
So honestly, I don't know
what the right answer is.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.843
I'm not sure
how the members feel yet either.

09:11.926 --> 09:17.307
Depending on their thoughts,
I'll be able to make a final decision.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.142
So what should we do?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.894
[HYELIM] You can freely
share your opinions.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.313
We just need your honest thoughts.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.859
We voted on which song
the members liked best.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.278
But it was tough to choose
because they were both great songs.

09:30.862 --> 09:35.033
I think "Thunder"
shows a different side of SEVENTEEN.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.828
I also think "Thunder"

09:39.788 --> 09:42.123
is a song that people can accept easily.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.583
-[VERNON] I think so too.
-[THE 8] Definitely.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.044
-[MINGYU] "Thunder" is?
-The keyword is great too.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.171
When I first heard "Thunder,"

09:49.130 --> 09:50.215
I was a bit shocked.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.925
Among the songs

09:53.468 --> 09:56.554
WOOZI has produced so far,

09:56.638 --> 10:00.058
this one shows a fresh, different side.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.894
After hearing from WOOZI

10:02.977 --> 10:06.356
how the song came about,

10:06.439 --> 10:07.690
I became even more certain.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.652
The song itself is really good,

10:10.735 --> 10:14.197
and I think
people will want to listen to it.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.784
I think that's an important criteria
we should focus on,

10:17.867 --> 10:20.495
and "Thunder" fits that standard better.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.164
[SEUNGKWAN] That's why
"Thunder" became the title track.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.209
Compared to our past songs,

10:26.292 --> 10:30.213
it is sharper, more stylish, and groovier.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.715
It shows people a different side of us.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.551
It was literally a new challenge.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.554
I like both songs,
but "Thunder" has more votes so far.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.765
So let's go with "Thunder"
and rework the lyrics.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.142
We go with "Alo, alo."

10:42.225 --> 10:43.560
-How's that?
-[S.COUPS] Sounds good.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.104
[HYELIM] We need to practice this vibe.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.648
If you slack off during this one,
it won't look good.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.609
I kept thinking that only by being united

10:51.693 --> 10:54.195
can this album and project

10:54.279 --> 10:56.281
have a better chance of succeeding.

the work itself must be solid.

-And so...
-That's true.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.297
-I want to go beyond that stereotype.
-Mmm.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.674
It means that we must keep
discovering something new.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.884
Yes, exactly.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.553

47:25.593 --> 47:27.928
[members] Yes, MINGYU told us to.

47:29.096 --> 47:31.390
Where did you go during "Not Alone"?

47:31.474 --> 47:32.558
To the other side.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.144
You couldn't tell, right?

47:35.811 --> 47:37.897
-VERNON, during "Oh My!"
-I couldn't.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.565
[HYELIM] Why did you rap in Korean?

47:39.648 --> 47:41.275
I like "LOVE, MONEY, FAME."

47:41.359 --> 47:43.361
[HYELIM] You just realized that now?

47:44.111 --> 47:45.446
If we stay down here...

47:45.529 --> 47:49.325
Go, VERNON! Let's go! You got this!

47:49.408 --> 47:52.453
He sang all of "Oh My!"
in Korean by himself.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.246
-[JOSHUA] You just noticed?
-Yeah.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.540
[MINGYU] Man, that's too much.
