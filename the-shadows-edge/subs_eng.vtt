WEBVTT

01:35.812 --> 01:36.396
Copy that.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.187
Thank you, sir.

01:37.562 --> 01:38.562
Target secured.

01:38.562 --> 01:39.729
Our team's on their way back.

01:41.021 --> 01:42.896
Command Central, this is Patrol Unit 00638.

01:42.896 --> 01:43.979
We're headed back. Over.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.021
Copy that.

01:45.646 --> 01:47.062
It's time.

02:02.729 --> 02:05.312
Opening with a little pawn.

02:15.937 --> 02:16.646
What's wrong?

02:17.312 --> 02:18.187
Probably nothing.

02:18.187 --> 02:20.062
I thought there was a glitch.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.812
Madam,

02:26.812 --> 02:29.271
Macao Asia Bank's vault alarm was tripped.

02:29.271 --> 02:30.896
CPSP Police received the alarm, too.

02:30.896 --> 02:32.771
Their patrol units are on the way.

02:32.771 --> 02:34.021
Where is their nearby patrol unit?

02:34.021 --> 02:35.062
They left two minutes ago.

02:35.062 --> 02:35.937
They're on the bridge.

02:35.937 --> 02:36.979
ETA five minutes.

02:36.979 --> 02:37.687
Where's our people?

02:38.021 --> 02:38.562
Madam.

02:38.562 --> 02:39.312
Captain Wu Yaolei here.

02:39.312 --> 02:40.729
Alpha team in pursuit.

02:41.354 --> 02:42.771
Du Ping, activate S.P.A.I.S.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.271
S.P.A.I.S. activated.

02:46.021 --> 02:48.062
Reverse tracking 4,328 Skyeye cameras

02:48.062 --> 02:50.437
within 3 km of the bank.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.396
Scanning suspicious vehicles.

02:56.146 --> 02:56.979
Skyeye countertracking.

02:56.979 --> 02:57.646
Got something.

03:01.687 --> 03:03.479
They're not after cash.

03:03.479 --> 03:04.604
What do you mean?

03:04.604 --> 03:05.437
They're empty-handed.

03:05.646 --> 03:08.354
Madam, got them on Camera 120C,

03:08.354 --> 03:10.604
exiting Liwan Roundabout, southbound.

03:11.062 --> 03:12.396
Direct all nearby patrol cars

03:12.396 --> 03:14.146
to cut off their escape route.

03:14.146 --> 03:14.687
Yes, Madam.

03:15.104 --> 03:16.146
Attention, all units.

03:16.146 --> 03:17.812
Suspect vehicle is a black MPV

03:17.812 --> 03:19.437
disguised as a taxi.

03:19.687 --> 03:20.937
Unit Charlie 2-5.

03:20.937 --> 03:22.812
proceed to the intersection of

03:22.812 --> 03:24.854
Estr. do Eng. Trigo and Estr. de Cacilhas.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.521
Bravo 6, Estr. sul de Lychee intersection.

03:27.521 --> 03:30.479
Delta 9-2, standby at midsection of Estrada do Sul.

03:34.521 --> 03:35.646
With Skyeye and Spice Girl,

03:35.937 --> 03:37.104
they've got nowhere to hide.

03:38.937 --> 03:40.104
Block off Rua do Campo.

03:40.104 --> 03:42.354
Tap Seac Tunnel and Estr. do Cemiterio,

03:42.354 --> 03:43.104
Seal them off.

03:43.312 --> 03:43.896
Madam,

03:43.896 --> 03:45.104
Spice Girl is against this plan.

03:45.104 --> 03:47.187
All units, head to Estr. de Cacilhas,

03:47.187 --> 03:48.021
Prepare to intercept.

03:48.021 --> 03:48.979
Not to intercept.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.062
What's the problem?

03:50.854 --> 03:51.521
Du Ping,

03:51.521 --> 03:53.521
disable autonomous analysis and command.

03:53.521 --> 03:54.104
Yes, ma'am.

03:54.896 --> 03:56.187
Alpha Teams 1 and 2,

03:56.187 --> 03:57.979
go east to Dom Belchior Carneiro Street.

03:57.979 --> 04:00.104
Unit 3, southeast to Tomas Vieira Street.

04:00.104 --> 04:02.646
Unit 4, go north on Artilheiros Street.

04:02.646 --> 04:04.479
Box the bastards at Repouso Road.

04:04.479 --> 04:05.229
Yes, ma’am.

04:05.229 --> 04:06.354
All units, split up.

04:06.354 --> 04:06.937
Yes, sir.

04:06.937 --> 04:07.479
Yes, sir.

04:30.396 --> 04:30.978
Wu Yaolei.

04:32.771 --> 04:33.312
Wu Yaolei.

04:33.312 --> 04:34.021
What are you doing?

04:34.937 --> 04:36.062
Arrest them.

04:36.062 --> 04:37.103
Come on？

04:37.103 --> 04:38.062
We’re at Repouso Road.

04:38.521 --> 04:39.603
No visual on suspect vehicle.

04:39.603 --> 04:40.937
What do you mean no visual?

04:40.937 --> 04:41.978
It’s right there.

04:41.978 --> 04:43.103
Are you all blind?

04:51.896 --> 04:52.478
Madam.

04:53.187 --> 04:54.062
Can you see me?

04:56.728 --> 04:57.312
Madam.

05:04.187 --> 05:05.104
What do we do now?

05:09.854 --> 05:10.396
Pawn out.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.312
Knight knight.

06:03.854 --> 06:05.229
Can I help you, sir?

06:05.521 --> 06:05.979
Latte.

06:10.479 --> 06:13.229
Larry, you lazy son of a bitch, get the door.

06:15.479 --> 06:15.979
What?

06:20.646 --> 06:21.396
Police.

06:26.103 --> 06:27.562
Sure about not going to the bank?

06:27.562 --> 06:28.437
Why would I want to go?

06:28.437 --> 06:30.937
The paper with half of my password was stolen, right?

06:31.478 --> 06:32.146
Right?

06:32.686 --> 06:34.021
They probably wouldn't act this fast.

06:34.021 --> 06:35.312
No, they want the other half.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.312
They need the other half.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.187
Without the other half,

06:37.187 --> 06:38.103
all of this would be for nothing.

06:38.103 --> 06:39.978
What exactly is cryptocurrency?

06:39.978 --> 06:40.978
Money, sir.

06:40.978 --> 06:42.062
Over 500 million HK dollars.

06:42.478 --> 06:44.228
No answer at JH Digital Asset Management.

06:49.771 --> 06:50.812
They may be doing it right now.

06:50.812 --> 06:52.228
Hi, Aoxing Tower security office.

06:52.228 --> 06:52.687
Hello, sir.

06:52.687 --> 06:54.771
This is Polícia Judiciária Command Center.

06:54.771 --> 06:55.978
We suspect that someone on the 4th floor

06:55.978 --> 06:57.646
at JH Digital Asset Management

06:57.646 --> 06:59.562
is attempting to steal sensitive data.

06:59.562 --> 07:00.812
Please don't act on your own.

07:00.812 --> 07:02.187
What's the police's ETA?

07:02.354 --> 07:03.479
What's your ETA?

07:03.479 --> 07:04.187
Within five minutes.

07:04.687 --> 07:05.479
Understood.

07:07.229 --> 07:07.854
Three minutes.

07:07.854 --> 07:08.937
Got it. Three minutes.

07:19.812 --> 07:20.437
Found it.

07:21.562 --> 07:22.228
Damn...

07:22.228 --> 07:22.896
So many files.

07:22.896 --> 07:23.603
Copy them all.

07:23.603 --> 07:25.062
Can't you transfer the money out yourself?

07:25.062 --> 07:26.562
Account passwords for cryptocurrency

07:26.562 --> 07:28.103
consist of twelve English words,

07:28.103 --> 07:28.978
all randomly generated.

07:28.978 --> 07:32.103
That's 2048 to the 12th power.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.603
That's an algorithm behind it.

07:33.603 --> 07:34.437
You've no idea.

07:34.896 --> 07:35.562
Sit back.

07:36.646 --> 07:37.812
It's impossible to memorize.

07:39.937 --> 07:40.812
Two minutes.

07:54.603 --> 07:55.396
Xin, what are you doing?

07:55.396 --> 07:56.103
Just look around.

07:56.103 --> 07:57.396
Don’t touch anything else.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.687
Lots of VIP clients.

08:03.687 --> 08:04.604
Gordon D.

08:09.146 --> 08:09.854
What is this?

08:10.104 --> 08:10.896
Digital encryption key.

08:11.937 --> 08:13.104
It's Duan Zhihong.

08:13.646 --> 08:14.604
Who’s Duan Zhihong?

08:14.604 --> 08:16.812
CEO of Kuala Lumpur's biggest crypto exchange.

08:16.812 --> 08:18.271
He vanished with $1.5 billion USD,

08:18.271 --> 08:20.271
then mysteriously turned up dead in Macau.

08:20.521 --> 08:22.228
People still think he faked his own death.

08:23.812 --> 08:25.562
This digital key's firewall is

08:25.562 --> 08:26.978
TAQ-LX-5 level.

08:27.437 --> 08:28.187
What does that mean?

08:28.187 --> 08:29.978
One level short of military-grade.

08:29.978 --> 08:30.896
Why is such an important key

08:30.896 --> 08:32.521
hidden in a crappy server like this?

08:32.521 --> 08:33.978
I heard Duan's $1.5 billion

08:33.978 --> 08:35.021
is still unaccounted for.

08:35.771 --> 08:37.478
That's over HK$10 billion.

08:37.478 --> 08:38.228
Copy everything.

08:38.228 --> 08:39.896
We're out of time, Simon.

08:39.896 --> 08:40.603
Won't take long.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.021
Xin, we’re leaving.

08:42.271 --> 08:42.811
Give me a minute.

08:42.811 --> 08:44.061
There's no time.

09:11.104 --> 09:11.854
Go.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.146
Heads down.

09:14.646 --> 09:15.396
Don't look.

09:20.104 --> 09:21.187
Police are at the entrance.

09:26.271 --> 09:26.979
Don’t panic.

09:27.646 --> 09:28.562
What’s going on upstairs?

09:34.729 --> 09:35.479
Sorry.

09:35.479 --> 09:36.646
Hi, who are you?

09:36.646 --> 09:37.271
Police.

09:40.354 --> 09:41.561
We have a report of a robbery.

09:41.561 --> 09:42.561
Suspects just left.

09:42.771 --> 09:43.396
Four males,

09:43.396 --> 09:44.186
early twenties.

09:48.146 --> 09:49.021
Go Bishop.

09:50.479 --> 09:50.936
Go.

09:50.936 --> 09:51.854
Get them.

09:52.186 --> 09:53.604
Song, cut them off.

09:56.854 --> 09:57.479
Freeze.

09:57.479 --> 09:58.104
Stop.

09:58.271 --> 09:59.436
Alpha 3 and4 have arrived.

09:59.436 --> 10:00.646
Bravo 4 on-site.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.146
Bravo 1 and 2, watch the lobby.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.646
Bravo 3 and 4, block the exits.

10:07.104 --> 10:07.937
Bravo 3 on-site.

10:07.937 --> 10:09.771
Qiuguo, assist Forensics on the 4th floor.

10:09.979 --> 10:10.437
Yes, sir.

10:22.896 --> 10:23.604
Stop.

10:55.021 --> 10:55.936
Don't move.

10:57.729 --> 10:58.354
Freeze.

10:58.354 --> 10:58.811
Don't move.

10:58.811 --> 10:59.646
Drop the gun.

10:59.936 --> 11:00.521
Drop the gun.

11:00.521 --> 11:01.021
Don't move.

11:01.937 --> 11:02.354
Freeze.

11:02.354 --> 11:03.021
Don't move.

11:03.229 --> 11:03.979
Put the gun down.

11:04.187 --> 11:05.354
Don't worry about me, do your job.

11:08.104 --> 11:09.187
Captain Wu's been held hostage.

11:09.187 --> 11:10.062
They're going up.

11:11.562 --> 11:12.229
Wynn Macau.

11:12.479 --> 11:12.896
The boys,

11:12.896 --> 11:13.437
may be...

11:14.646 --> 11:16.187
Wynn, let's go.

11:16.187 --> 11:16.979
What are you waiting for?

11:42.646 --> 11:43.229
Captain.

11:47.896 --> 11:48.771
Wu Yaolei.

12:12.687 --> 12:13.521
Fake.

12:26.396 --> 12:27.729
-Help me. -Pull.

12:30.312 --> 12:31.312
They have parachutes.

12:32.896 --> 12:33.561
Captain.

12:36.936 --> 12:38.146
Send reinforcements

12:38.146 --> 12:38.936
to Wynn Macau.

12:38.936 --> 12:39.646
Go.

12:39.646 --> 12:41.604
Captain, elevators are hacked.

12:41.604 --> 12:42.479
How will you come down?

12:43.561 --> 12:44.186
I'm jumping.

12:44.186 --> 12:45.061
Jumping?

12:46.479 --> 12:47.021
Stay where you are.

13:03.396 --> 13:04.354
Wynn Macau, rooftop.

13:04.354 --> 13:05.271
You really jumped?

13:05.271 --> 13:06.187
Attention, all units.

13:06.396 --> 13:08.354
Send backup to new target location.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.187
Wynn Macau.

13:09.187 --> 13:10.146
Assist with the arrest.

13:10.312 --> 13:11.312
I've called their security chief,

13:11.312 --> 13:12.437
Mathew Tab.

13:12.437 --> 13:13.271
Sit back.

13:13.396 --> 13:14.062
They're coming on the rooftop.

13:14.062 --> 13:14.771
Call for backup.

13:15.104 --> 13:15.812
Call for backup.

13:16.562 --> 13:17.104
Call for backup.

13:17.104 --> 13:17.812
Call for backup.

13:19.646 --> 13:20.729
They must have a plan B,

13:20.729 --> 13:21.937
tell Tab to watch out.

13:25.687 --> 13:26.729
This isn't that simple.

13:27.271 --> 13:28.062
What?

13:47.436 --> 13:48.146
What do you mean?

13:48.561 --> 13:49.561
How can they just vanish

13:49.561 --> 13:50.936
from all the cameras?

13:51.146 --> 13:51.896
That's what they did.

14:08.354 --> 14:09.562
You look like shit.

14:10.396 --> 14:11.146
Where are they?

14:11.354 --> 14:12.271
They're in the hotel.

14:15.687 --> 14:17.104
Xin, the police have arrived.

14:17.604 --> 14:18.229
That's fast.

14:18.229 --> 14:19.229
Rook route is dead.

14:19.229 --> 14:19.896
Take the queen route.

14:19.896 --> 14:20.937
How'd you let them run?

14:20.937 --> 14:22.854
They did not run, they flew.

14:25.396 --> 14:26.146
Fifteen seconds.

14:26.146 --> 14:26.771
Ready for Queen.

14:26.771 --> 14:27.562
I need a location.

14:27.812 --> 14:28.521
Looking for it.

14:29.604 --> 14:30.937
Find them, and fast.

14:35.646 --> 14:36.396
What's going on?

14:36.396 --> 14:37.104
Not us.

14:39.811 --> 14:41.061
What the hell happened to my cameras?

14:41.061 --> 14:43.979
Wynn's surveillance was remotely shut down.

14:44.896 --> 14:45.479
Everyone.

14:45.479 --> 14:46.311
Get moving.

14:46.311 --> 14:47.186
Split up, eyes open.

14:47.436 --> 14:48.604
As long as they're still in here,

14:48.604 --> 14:49.854
they can't keep their faces hidden.

14:59.229 --> 15:00.146
Everyone,

15:00.687 --> 15:02.062
turn on your body cameras.

15:02.062 --> 15:04.021
Capture every face you come across.

15:07.021 --> 15:07.646
Du Ping.

15:07.646 --> 15:08.562
Operate S.P.A.I.S. manually.

15:08.562 --> 15:09.854
Run facial recognition on all live images

15:09.854 --> 15:10.854
caught on body cameras.

15:10.854 --> 15:11.396
On it.

15:11.396 --> 15:12.521
Find those without entry records,

15:12.521 --> 15:13.687
starting with the staff area.

15:14.729 --> 15:15.812
Don’t get caught on camera.

15:16.146 --> 15:17.146
Or we're screwed.

15:20.646 --> 15:21.479
I'm in.

15:21.479 --> 15:22.812
Tell me your whereabouts,

15:23.062 --> 15:24.979
I'll handle it from here.

15:25.187 --> 15:26.146
King's move.

15:38.186 --> 15:39.061
Turn around.

15:43.811 --> 15:44.729
Locker room.

15:44.729 --> 15:45.229
Change.

15:48.229 --> 15:49.229
Excuse me, sir.

15:49.604 --> 15:50.061
Sir.

16:06.521 --> 16:09.312
Alpha 2 is taking elevator MCS1 to Ground Floor.

16:09.646 --> 16:10.271
Ray.

16:10.271 --> 16:10.896
Turn around.

16:10.896 --> 16:12.021
Take the cart at your 10.

16:20.812 --> 16:21.896
Attention all units,

16:21.896 --> 16:23.479
Suspects may have changed disguises.

16:23.479 --> 16:25.104
Stay sharp, keep moving.

16:31.104 --> 16:32.021
175 centimeters,

16:32.021 --> 16:32.561
medium length hair,

16:32.561 --> 16:33.854
black and white hooded baseball jacket,

16:33.854 --> 16:34.896
dark camouflage multi-pocket pants,

16:34.896 --> 16:35.354
Backpack.

16:35.354 --> 16:36.604
He just headed to the cafeteria.

16:36.979 --> 16:37.771
Xin.

16:37.771 --> 16:38.729
You’re blown.

16:39.104 --> 16:39.604
Feng,

16:39.896 --> 16:40.771
burn that face.

16:40.771 --> 16:41.521
Help Xin.

16:41.811 --> 16:42.354
Yes, sir.

16:53.521 --> 16:55.061
Song, the guy who just passed by.

16:56.896 --> 16:57.396
Now.

16:57.686 --> 16:58.854
He has no entry record.

16:58.854 --> 16:59.396
What?

17:00.062 --> 17:00.729
There.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.312
That's him.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.312
I got this one.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.687
Song, go after the other guy.

17:05.811 --> 17:06.229
Excuse me.

17:06.229 --> 17:07.686
Song, wipe the lens.

17:11.686 --> 17:12.561
Go get that one.

17:12.561 --> 17:13.061
Go.

17:13.561 --> 17:14.271
Move.

17:40.562 --> 17:41.104
I'm sorry.

17:43.021 --> 17:43.604
Where is he?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.354
The Wynn Prosperity Tree lobby is packed.

17:59.187 --> 18:01.479
I thought the show is after 12.

18:01.479 --> 18:02.854
When there's a system upgrade,

18:02.854 --> 18:04.521
they run a test show that morning.

18:05.812 --> 18:06.354
Find them.

18:06.354 --> 18:07.479
Spread out.

18:07.604 --> 18:09.271
Eyes peeled, stay sharp.

18:13.187 --> 18:13.937
Over there.

18:18.437 --> 18:19.437
They're posing as cops.

18:19.562 --> 18:20.771
They're posing as cops.

18:37.729 --> 18:38.396
Checkmate.

18:43.271 --> 18:44.396
It's all gone.

18:44.396 --> 18:45.312
500 million.

18:45.312 --> 18:47.312
Not a penny left.

18:47.521 --> 18:50.312
Crypto is impossible to trace!

18:50.312 --> 18:52.687
You police are useless!

19:01.312 --> 19:02.312
They hacked us

19:02.312 --> 19:03.646
and infiltrated the surveillance system.

19:04.021 --> 19:04.604
So...

19:04.604 --> 19:05.937
Without Skyeye,

19:05.937 --> 19:06.979
we can't fight crimes anymore,

19:06.979 --> 19:07.729
Is that it?

19:07.812 --> 19:09.979
Before we had all this technology,

19:09.979 --> 19:11.854
how did the police do their jobs?

19:12.771 --> 19:14.146
It was my mistake.

19:14.854 --> 19:15.729
I'll catch them next time.

19:15.729 --> 19:16.854
Even if there's a next time,

19:16.854 --> 19:19.604
they'll probably still counter our every move.

19:19.604 --> 19:20.396
So tell me...

19:20.396 --> 19:21.271
What do we do?

19:21.604 --> 19:23.021
If they stop now,

19:23.021 --> 19:24.187
where's our breakthrough?

19:25.312 --> 19:26.062
Sorry, sir.

19:26.812 --> 19:28.021
What's the progress

19:28.021 --> 19:29.312
from cyber division?

19:29.312 --> 19:31.646
We've patched the intrusion point and code bugs,

19:31.646 --> 19:33.104
but no progress on reverse tracking.

19:36.771 --> 19:38.229
To catch a cunning fox,

19:38.229 --> 19:39.646
we need an experienced hunter.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.021
Are you suggesting

19:45.021 --> 19:46.396
bringing back Wong?

19:51.229 --> 19:53.354
I know he's your old boss.

19:53.354 --> 19:54.729
But this is the era of A.I. tracking.

19:54.729 --> 19:56.729
And they've just exploited its weakness.

19:58.187 --> 19:59.271
There are flaws in the network

19:59.271 --> 20:00.604
and surveillance equipment,

20:00.604 --> 20:02.021
but S.P.A.I.S. is flawless.

20:02.021 --> 20:03.729
You stopped S.P.A.I.S. learning from real operations.

20:03.729 --> 20:06.229
You let your phone tell you how to do your job?

20:06.229 --> 20:07.604
That doesn't mean bringing in a fossil

20:07.604 --> 20:08.979
will fix the police's image.

20:08.979 --> 20:09.937
Captain.

20:10.437 --> 20:13.896
I don't care if we use fossil or Spice Girl,

20:13.896 --> 20:15.937
Find them, catch them.

20:15.937 --> 20:17.187
Do your job.

20:20.312 --> 20:22.521
Jeez, Guoguo,

20:22.521 --> 20:24.479
have you seen Wong's file?

20:25.396 --> 20:26.396
He's incredible.

20:26.729 --> 20:28.687
Multiple commendations.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.396
Special Ops all-around champion.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.146
Police hand-to-hand combat champion.

20:33.562 --> 20:35.062
Five years straight!

20:35.062 --> 20:36.312
Proficient in firearms,

20:36.312 --> 20:36.937
surveillance,

20:36.937 --> 20:37.729
infiltration,

20:37.729 --> 20:39.396
intelligence gathering.

20:39.396 --> 20:41.771
He’s gone undercover in drug cartels

20:41.771 --> 20:44.312
and organ trafficking rings.

20:44.729 --> 20:46.479
Restrained, low-profile.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.937
Skilled at blending in.

20:48.604 --> 20:49.937
Hobby...

20:49.937 --> 20:51.021
Making up call signs.

20:52.062 --> 20:54.354
This says his career's single stain is

20:54.354 --> 20:58.146
a major personal mistake that killed

20:58.521 --> 20:59.396
his partner.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.312
Write down which dog pees and poos first.

21:14.312 --> 21:16.062
Is that really him?

21:19.479 --> 21:20.062
Hi.

21:20.437 --> 21:21.646
Have you find it?

21:21.646 --> 21:22.771
Nope.

21:23.687 --> 21:26.104
Everyone else is on the field for the big case

21:26.687 --> 21:29.104
and I have no idea what I’m doing.

21:29.104 --> 21:30.562
Observing someone's retirement?

21:30.562 --> 21:31.521
Be patient.

21:31.521 --> 21:33.312
Maybe captain's looking out for you.

21:33.312 --> 21:35.771
Perhaps we're not ready for the field yet.

21:35.771 --> 21:36.437
I’ll call you later.

22:10.979 --> 22:12.687
A training drill on a geezer like me?

22:14.396 --> 22:15.437
Come again?

22:19.937 --> 22:20.979
Why are you following me?

22:24.104 --> 22:25.812
You're mistaking me for someone else.

22:28.396 --> 22:29.271
You don’t know me?

22:31.271 --> 22:32.104
I don't.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.396
Do you need something?

22:37.562 --> 22:39.937
You weren't tailing me in a jacket in reverse?

22:41.771 --> 22:43.354
Can you sit elsewhere?

22:53.271 --> 22:53.979
Sorry.

22:53.979 --> 22:54.729
It’s fine.

23:02.354 --> 23:05.354
At 14:23, you reached the first target,

23:05.354 --> 23:07.396
which was the pet shop,

23:07.396 --> 23:08.062
Up to now,

23:08.062 --> 23:10.729
you've tailed me for 4 hours and 17 minutes.

23:10.729 --> 23:12.521
You changed your outfit three times,

23:13.562 --> 23:15.312
and stopped 9 times to jot notes.

23:15.479 --> 23:16.562
On the bus,

23:16.562 --> 23:18.396
you had a colleague help you.

23:19.562 --> 23:20.229
Watch it.

23:20.229 --> 23:20.854
Pardon me.

23:21.479 --> 23:22.646
Am I right, He Qiuguo?

23:30.854 --> 23:31.729
That look

23:31.729 --> 23:32.979
just gave you away.

23:36.687 --> 23:38.146
You remember me,

23:38.146 --> 23:38.896
Uncle Wong.

23:38.896 --> 23:40.979
We haven't met since I was 8.

23:43.187 --> 23:44.854
I heard you joined the force

23:44.854 --> 23:46.312
and inherited your father's badge number.

23:47.521 --> 23:48.479
He would be proud.

23:51.521 --> 23:53.729
How'd you know when I was at the pet shop?

23:54.396 --> 23:55.729
I have a few pointers.

23:57.021 --> 23:57.771
First of all,

23:58.104 --> 23:59.479
never throw away your notes.

23:59.479 --> 24:00.021
Second,

24:00.187 --> 24:00.771
dog walking time,

24:00.771 --> 24:01.396
leaving work,

24:01.396 --> 24:02.604
and boarding the bus

24:02.604 --> 24:03.521
were all inaccurate.

24:03.521 --> 24:05.729
The order of dogs pee and poo is a mess.

24:05.729 --> 24:07.354
Which one was the sixth to poop?

24:07.354 --> 24:08.271
Al Paca-paca,

24:08.271 --> 24:09.187
the poodle.

24:15.562 --> 24:17.396
It'd be my mistake if I didn't pick it up.

24:17.396 --> 24:19.437
Confuse my memory if I did.

24:20.021 --> 24:20.604
Not bad.

24:21.396 --> 24:23.146
You said my colleague was on the bus.

24:23.146 --> 24:23.979
Why do you say that?

24:24.937 --> 24:25.687
Oh, I see.

24:26.021 --> 24:27.104
This isn't training.

24:27.104 --> 24:29.187
You're checking

24:29.437 --> 24:30.479
if I’ve still got it.

24:36.479 --> 24:40.021
You two tailed me for 4 hours at that skill level.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.437
Who gave you the confidence?

24:59.937 --> 25:00.896
Long time no see, Officer Wong.

25:00.896 --> 25:02.729
This is inspector Wu Yaolei.

25:06.104 --> 25:06.646
Let me do it.

25:06.979 --> 25:07.437
No.

25:12.771 --> 25:13.771
You call yourself a cop?

25:13.771 --> 25:15.562
No wonder I felt that old man touched me.

25:15.937 --> 25:17.521
Sound like you're proud of it.

25:19.104 --> 25:20.812
So the partner

25:21.646 --> 25:22.854
who died on duty...

25:23.896 --> 25:24.437
That was your dad?

25:27.604 --> 25:28.062
Back off.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.896
These are footage we gathered from the scene.

25:33.396 --> 25:34.187
This footage is

25:34.187 --> 25:36.521
Wynn's feed before hackers cut it.

25:45.104 --> 25:46.771
Just play the last 15 seconds, please.

25:55.271 --> 25:56.062
Play it again.

26:07.354 --> 26:08.062
Once more.

26:25.021 --> 26:25.521
Stop.

26:44.646 --> 26:45.854
How did you spot them?

26:45.854 --> 26:47.979
They peeked at cameras when they entered.

26:49.479 --> 26:50.812
They must have scouted beforehand

26:50.812 --> 26:51.937
and knew where the cameras were.

26:51.937 --> 26:52.937
Why'd they look, then?

26:52.937 --> 26:54.646
To see if the cameras were still on.

26:56.979 --> 26:58.312
Once the cameras were cut,

26:58.312 --> 26:59.604
they changed their disguises.

27:01.604 --> 27:02.354
Didn’t they?

27:13.729 --> 27:14.187
Xiwang.

27:23.312 --> 27:25.354
Old man pissed over the change of plans?

27:26.062 --> 27:27.062
What do you think?

27:29.187 --> 27:30.521
Go console him.

27:32.061 --> 27:32.686
Godfather...

27:32.686 --> 27:33.771
We all made it back safely.

27:33.771 --> 27:35.271
Hell of a day, wasn't it?

27:35.896 --> 27:36.771
I can explain.

27:38.562 --> 27:40.479
You almost got everyone killed.

27:40.479 --> 27:42.146
That wasn’t part of the plan.

27:44.437 --> 27:45.812
But we got the job done.

27:46.937 --> 27:48.896
With a bonus, no less.

27:49.771 --> 27:51.187
What bonus?

27:51.187 --> 27:52.479
I only saw mistakes.

27:54.896 --> 27:56.021
All these years,

27:56.021 --> 27:57.396
I've never been caught on camera.

27:57.812 --> 27:58.854
Now I have,

27:59.562 --> 28:00.979
you little shit!

28:01.187 --> 28:03.062
It'll be fine, I'll handle it.

28:03.062 --> 28:04.229
You're a little shit too.

28:06.062 --> 28:07.062
Just let go.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.854
Let us call the shots for once.

28:14.229 --> 28:15.062
Let go?

28:23.229 --> 28:24.312
Let go.

28:39.562 --> 28:40.729
Can you tell me

28:42.521 --> 28:44.396
what I should be scared of now?

28:48.729 --> 28:50.604
You wouldn't understand it anyway.

28:54.062 --> 28:55.854
Let me tell you

28:55.854 --> 28:57.521
what you should fear.

29:06.354 --> 29:06.937
Godfather.

29:17.312 --> 29:18.896
Even you're turning on me.

29:21.771 --> 29:22.229
Godfather.

29:22.562 --> 29:23.729
It's our fault.

29:23.854 --> 29:25.729
For decades, no one's had a photo of me.

29:25.854 --> 29:27.479
That's changed because of you shitheads.

29:27.646 --> 29:28.604
Don't be mad.

29:28.604 --> 29:30.396
That's more than 10 billion sweet HKD.

29:30.396 --> 29:31.146
With this money,

29:31.146 --> 29:32.646
we can all live our dreams.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.437
Shut it. You know how deep you were in danger?

29:43.021 --> 29:44.062
That tall guy.

29:44.062 --> 29:45.979
The walking lightning rod changed outfits.

29:45.979 --> 29:46.812
Eyes on the screen.

29:47.312 --> 29:47.937
Lightning Rod.

29:49.104 --> 29:49.854
Remember his characteristics.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.437
This guy, grinding his teeth.

29:52.437 --> 29:53.437
Number 2, number 2.

29:53.937 --> 29:55.062
Found the one with the earrings.

29:55.437 --> 29:55.937
That's right.

29:56.271 --> 29:56.729
That's him.

29:56.937 --> 29:57.396
Send it.

29:57.687 --> 29:58.229
On the screen,

29:58.229 --> 29:59.312
that's Lil Puppy no. 2.

29:59.604 --> 30:00.854
Lightning Rod 3 spotted,

30:00.854 --> 30:01.646
not very clear though.

30:01.646 --> 30:02.896
I've got a decent shot over here.

30:02.896 --> 30:03.854
Very good, very good.

30:03.854 --> 30:04.937
Pretty Face number 2,

30:04.937 --> 30:05.854
wearing a small mustache.

30:05.854 --> 30:06.187
Got it.

30:06.187 --> 30:07.104
I got Pretty Face number 3.

30:07.104 --> 30:07.687
The squatting one.

30:07.812 --> 30:08.479
He changed disguises.

30:08.479 --> 30:10.187
How many fake mustaches does he have?

30:16.021 --> 30:17.354
Sir, I think this one is...

30:17.354 --> 30:18.646
Pretty Face number 4.

30:19.604 --> 30:21.187
I've seen this coat somewhere.

30:24.146 --> 30:25.354
Someone gave it to him!

30:25.646 --> 30:26.562
Everybody, listen up.

30:26.562 --> 30:27.604
There's one more person.

30:27.896 --> 30:29.021
Cast everything you find

30:29.021 --> 30:30.104
to the main screen.

30:30.104 --> 30:30.521
Yes, sir.

30:30.521 --> 30:30.896
Yes, sir.

30:30.896 --> 30:31.437
Yes, sir.

30:48.187 --> 30:48.812
Police.

30:48.812 --> 30:49.396
Police.

30:50.854 --> 30:51.937
Sorry.

31:11.646 --> 31:12.271
Xiwang.

31:15.312 --> 31:16.562
You saved my life once.

31:19.604 --> 31:21.146
I value this life very much.

31:23.604 --> 31:25.979
I don't want anything to happen to you all.

31:28.646 --> 31:29.479
Got that?

31:32.646 --> 31:33.271
Got it.

31:34.271 --> 31:35.521
We're with you,

31:35.729 --> 31:36.937
live or die.

31:45.771 --> 31:46.937
I don't want to die.

31:50.271 --> 31:53.562
I want all of us to enjoy our lives.

31:58.062 --> 32:00.062
Ms. Sun, the lobby café barista,

32:00.062 --> 32:02.146
took this photo that afternoon.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.062
This is very likely the fifth person at Wynn.

32:05.562 --> 32:06.354
Do we have any idea

32:06.354 --> 32:07.187
of his identity?

32:07.812 --> 32:09.604
Sorry sir, not yet.

32:12.771 --> 32:14.521
In the late 80s,

32:14.521 --> 32:16.896
there was a wanted foreign ex-special force

32:17.146 --> 32:19.146
known as "The Shadow".

32:19.146 --> 32:22.687
He served in an elite assassination squad.

32:22.687 --> 32:24.646
During the war, he disguised himself

32:24.646 --> 32:26.979
to infiltrate military and political targets.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.021
His kills were executed up close with a knife.

32:29.021 --> 32:30.187
And he always got away.

32:30.187 --> 32:32.854
Later, he fled here to seek greater wealth.

32:33.187 --> 32:35.896
He planned more than a dozen bank heists

32:35.896 --> 32:37.937
and evaded three manhunts

32:37.937 --> 32:39.812
before vanishing without a trace in 1999.

32:40.646 --> 32:42.646
This guy could be the Shadow

32:43.562 --> 32:45.396
coming out of retirement.

32:46.062 --> 32:47.104
I remember him.

32:47.104 --> 32:48.521
What's your next step?

32:48.521 --> 32:51.562
This photo isn't enough for facial recognition.

32:51.562 --> 32:52.646
We plan to increase manpower

32:52.646 --> 32:54.437
for a comprehensive sweep.

32:54.437 --> 32:55.062
Area?

32:55.312 --> 32:57.562
We have few shots of his accomplice's vehicle.

32:57.562 --> 32:59.521
These were all taken in the Old Town area.

32:59.521 --> 33:00.271
It’s a large area.

33:00.271 --> 33:02.104
I suggest a two-pronged approach.

33:02.104 --> 33:03.729
Conduct an open sweep for diversion

33:03.729 --> 33:05.687
while dispatching a covert surveillance team.

33:05.687 --> 33:06.521
Officer Wong.

33:07.437 --> 33:09.104
There’s no covert surveillance team anymore.

33:09.104 --> 33:10.146
Not anymore?

33:10.354 --> 33:13.021
With today's surveillance network and A.I.,

33:13.021 --> 33:15.146
traditional covert surveillance teams

33:15.146 --> 33:16.479
are hardly ever needed.

33:21.146 --> 33:22.271
Small suggestion

33:22.687 --> 33:23.937
for ground surveillance.

33:23.937 --> 33:26.646
You should use your most inconspicuous officers.

33:26.646 --> 33:28.812
Preferably ones suspects haven't seen before.

33:35.146 --> 33:35.729
Officer Wong,

33:36.187 --> 33:39.062
why don't you help us set up a temporary team?

33:41.812 --> 33:44.729
A covert team put together last-minute

33:44.729 --> 33:46.271
won’t be as effective as

33:46.271 --> 33:47.521
a comprehensive approach.

33:57.521 --> 33:58.312
Guoguo.

33:58.521 --> 34:00.729
Stay in your lane out there.

34:00.729 --> 34:02.146
Leave the arresting to us.

34:02.521 --> 34:03.354
Remember that.

34:03.354 --> 34:05.312
Guoguo can show off all she wants.

34:06.062 --> 34:09.354
I'm just worried that showing off will get to her head

34:09.354 --> 34:10.687
and let them slip away again.

34:14.812 --> 34:17.396
Why did someone so tiny become a cop?

34:17.396 --> 34:19.104
Her old man was a cop.

34:19.104 --> 34:19.646
Doesn’t she know

34:19.646 --> 34:22.104
she's just a poster child?

34:22.521 --> 34:23.854
Can't even crack a smile.

34:26.854 --> 34:28.854
What business is it of yours that I’m a cop?

34:28.854 --> 34:30.812
I earned my spot in the Police Force.

34:30.812 --> 34:32.021
How dare you.

34:32.646 --> 34:35.229
Don't forget, it was you idiots who let them get away.

34:36.937 --> 34:37.812
Com'on, I'm the suspect.

34:37.812 --> 34:38.562
Catch me.

34:38.562 --> 34:39.271
Com'on.

34:45.104 --> 34:47.104
Field agent? Yeah, right.

35:06.646 --> 35:07.312
Come on.

35:07.312 --> 35:09.187
Com'on, get him.

35:24.854 --> 35:26.229
In a place like the detective squad,

35:26.729 --> 35:27.979
a little spar will earn you respect.

35:28.562 --> 35:30.104
They'll watch your back out there.

35:34.437 --> 35:36.187
No one in this place thinks

35:36.187 --> 35:38.562
a woman could be the first to kick down a door.

35:39.479 --> 35:41.896
The first one can catch a bullet, too.

35:41.896 --> 35:43.187
So what?

35:43.604 --> 35:44.479
I'm not afraid to die.

35:44.479 --> 35:46.146
But they don't want you to die.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.271
My life isn’t their concern.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.437
They do care about their colleagues' lives.

35:50.437 --> 35:52.021
No one sees me as a colleague.

35:58.771 --> 35:59.646
Old friend...

36:01.521 --> 36:02.646
Guoguo's all grown up.

36:04.687 --> 36:05.812
She's just like you.

36:07.687 --> 36:10.896
But I can tell she's not happy in the squad.

36:13.146 --> 36:14.604
That short fuse of hers

36:15.104 --> 36:16.353
might get her in trouble

36:17.521 --> 36:18.687
out on the field.

36:19.396 --> 36:20.646
Freeze. Police.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.354
Rest assured.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.521
I'll look after her.

37:18.146 --> 37:19.062
I'll do it.

37:19.646 --> 37:21.021
I'll train a covert surveillance team.

37:21.521 --> 37:22.479
Let's catch him.

37:34.562 --> 37:36.771
How nice of Captain Wu to send so many.

37:48.479 --> 37:49.854
Thank you. Goodbye.

37:51.687 --> 37:52.854
You look like a cop.

37:55.062 --> 37:55.604
Thanks.

37:55.604 --> 37:56.187
Thanks.

37:57.062 --> 37:59.854
We're dealing with an old fox.

37:59.854 --> 38:01.146
An old-school thief.

38:01.521 --> 38:02.271
That's why

38:02.812 --> 38:03.562
I'm going to train you

38:03.562 --> 38:04.812
to become old-school hunters.

38:05.229 --> 38:05.812
Come.

38:06.854 --> 38:08.021
During surveillance,

38:08.021 --> 38:10.979
develop an instinct to watch and memorize.

38:11.604 --> 38:12.229
One glance.

38:12.229 --> 38:13.312
That's all you get.

38:13.896 --> 38:14.896
Focus on key characteristics.

38:14.896 --> 38:18.021
Remember prominent and permanent features.

38:18.604 --> 38:20.021
I had my hands on my hips just now.

38:20.021 --> 38:21.312
Which two fingers

38:21.812 --> 38:23.021
were in my belt loops?

38:23.021 --> 38:23.937
Left forefinger.

38:23.937 --> 38:25.021
Right middle finger.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.729
A surveillance team is an entity.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.354
It takes every member

38:37.354 --> 38:38.854
to complete a mission.

38:40.104 --> 38:40.979
Let's go.

38:42.771 --> 38:43.396
Guoguo.

38:46.646 --> 38:47.271
Get in.

38:50.021 --> 38:53.437
Starting today, you need to blend into the city.

38:53.437 --> 38:54.687
Let's put theory into action.

38:55.104 --> 38:56.729
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

38:56.979 --> 38:57.854
Officer Wong,

38:57.854 --> 38:58.687
what did you say?

38:59.062 --> 38:59.937
Doghead.

38:59.937 --> 39:00.521
That's me.

39:00.979 --> 39:02.562
My call sign.

39:02.562 --> 39:04.396
Adorable Unit's on site.

39:05.062 --> 39:06.562
I'll give your call signs now.

39:06.562 --> 39:07.896
Liu, you're Al Paca-paca.

39:08.937 --> 39:10.021
Can I get another one?

39:11.312 --> 39:11.896
I'll make it simpler.

39:11.896 --> 39:12.687
Alpaca.

39:14.187 --> 39:15.021
Okay.

39:15.021 --> 39:15.812
Wanwan...

39:15.812 --> 39:16.604
You're Tofu.

39:16.604 --> 39:17.312
Yang Zhiwei...

39:17.312 --> 39:17.979
Rice Noodles.

39:17.979 --> 39:18.729
Ting...

39:19.021 --> 39:19.687
Pudding.

39:19.937 --> 39:21.104
Sun Xu....

39:21.104 --> 39:21.979
Potstickers.

39:21.979 --> 39:22.771
Liao Qihang...

39:22.771 --> 39:23.729
Eggy.

39:23.729 --> 39:24.687
Qiao Weidong...

39:24.687 --> 39:25.312
Lucky.

39:25.562 --> 39:26.479
Song Keyu...

39:27.062 --> 39:28.021
Pork Bun.

39:30.437 --> 39:31.896
Isn't that body shaming?

39:31.896 --> 39:33.271
It's a local specialty.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.812
This is a foodie squad.

39:35.229 --> 39:36.271
Better than my old unit.

39:36.771 --> 39:37.646
He Qiuguo...

39:38.729 --> 39:39.687
Little Flower Piggy.

39:40.187 --> 39:40.979
Can I change it?

39:40.979 --> 39:42.271
I'll drop "Little".

39:43.354 --> 39:44.812
Then drop "Flower".

39:52.771 --> 39:53.604
Patience.

39:54.021 --> 39:55.354
You're my ace in the hole.

39:55.937 --> 39:57.604
Like I believe you.

40:01.354 --> 40:01.937
It's fine.

40:02.187 --> 40:03.479
I'm used to being benched.

40:04.896 --> 40:05.521
Boss,

40:05.729 --> 40:06.812
how much for this?

40:08.271 --> 40:08.937
Where'd you get this?

40:09.229 --> 40:09.896
None of your business.

40:09.896 --> 40:10.937
Pay her and send her off.

40:14.812 --> 40:15.479
Hey...

40:15.646 --> 40:17.979
Don't stare like they're suspects.

40:21.062 --> 40:21.896
Pull over.

40:36.229 --> 40:38.021
Are you really here?

40:38.021 --> 40:39.229
This is your third time

40:39.229 --> 40:40.229
in the same spot

40:40.229 --> 40:41.229
in the same outfit

40:41.229 --> 40:41.896
using the same hand

40:41.896 --> 40:43.687
to drink the same way.

40:43.687 --> 40:44.687
Your water

40:44.687 --> 40:46.104
is stuck at the same amount.

40:46.687 --> 40:48.437
I'm worried I'd need to pee.

40:48.437 --> 40:50.021
Dehydration kills you too.

40:50.437 --> 40:51.021
Drink.

41:22.354 --> 41:24.021
There's 10 billion at stake.

41:24.521 --> 41:25.479
Once we get it,

41:25.479 --> 41:27.146
we're set for life.

41:27.146 --> 41:29.021
It's just one last time.

41:29.021 --> 41:30.312
That's what you all think,

41:30.312 --> 41:31.354
isnt it?

41:33.021 --> 41:34.896
Money isn't everything.

41:35.562 --> 41:36.854
Freedom is.

41:37.437 --> 41:38.521
Different time,

41:39.062 --> 41:39.979
different game.

41:46.021 --> 41:47.479
If I let you plan

41:48.229 --> 41:49.521
the next mission...

41:50.271 --> 41:51.354
You know what you're doing?

42:08.687 --> 42:09.562
Simon.

42:10.646 --> 42:11.521
Dad.

42:14.646 --> 42:15.729
Dad.

42:15.812 --> 42:16.646
Xiwang

42:18.354 --> 42:19.104
You've grown so much.

42:19.562 --> 42:20.312
Come.

42:20.312 --> 42:20.771
Come on.

42:24.396 --> 42:25.396
Thanks, daddy!

42:27.354 --> 42:28.812
I have to leave for a while.

42:28.812 --> 42:29.937
Take good care of your brothers.

42:34.604 --> 42:36.021
I’ll come back for you boys.

42:42.146 --> 42:44.312
Duan stashed 1.5 billion USD worth of crypto.

42:44.312 --> 42:46.729
The server location has been found.

42:46.729 --> 42:48.271
We already have the decryption key,

42:48.271 --> 42:50.479
but the digital vault is hard to access.

42:50.896 --> 42:52.146
Simon's hiding at the orphanage,

42:52.146 --> 42:53.354
making plans right now

42:56.729 --> 42:58.062
Good place to hide.

42:58.479 --> 42:59.812
It holds a lot of memories.

43:01.354 --> 43:02.437
I know you're all tired,

43:02.437 --> 43:03.646
but stay focused.

43:17.479 --> 43:18.312
Don't want a coffee?

43:18.312 --> 43:19.104
Get a pick-me-up.

43:19.521 --> 43:21.062
Do I look tired to you?

43:23.604 --> 43:25.312
Have you thought about

43:25.312 --> 43:26.396
killing me?

43:27.729 --> 43:30.771
Then you can split my share.

43:32.854 --> 43:34.604
How could we, Godfather?

43:36.229 --> 43:37.937
I'm old anyway.

43:37.937 --> 43:39.521
I'll just be in your way.

43:43.271 --> 43:44.187
Am I right?

43:45.687 --> 43:47.229
Why'd you say

43:47.229 --> 43:48.646
I'm your ace in the hole?

43:56.437 --> 43:58.229
Are you gaslighting me?

43:59.854 --> 44:00.687
Gas what?

44:01.437 --> 44:02.854
If anyone even considers that,

44:02.854 --> 44:04.021
I'll kill him.

44:05.104 --> 44:06.437
The knife was already in your hand.

44:07.562 --> 44:08.979
You think I didn't see that?

44:11.021 --> 44:12.354
Am I not good enough?

44:12.354 --> 44:14.479
You think I need special treatment, too?

44:14.479 --> 44:15.229
No.

44:15.229 --> 44:16.228
You're fine.

44:17.104 --> 44:19.062
You don't need special treatment.

44:21.646 --> 44:23.104
When the knife's in your hand...

44:24.396 --> 44:25.687
Don't blink.

44:27.812 --> 44:29.146
Be forceful,

44:34.396 --> 44:36.646
or it wouldn't be a clean shave.

44:39.812 --> 44:41.604
Then why is everyone on the field

44:41.604 --> 44:44.062
and I'm sitting here, getting you coffee?

44:44.937 --> 44:45.646
You just really want to...

44:45.646 --> 44:46.229
Yes.

44:47.354 --> 44:48.104
I really want to.

44:58.521 --> 45:00.937
But I need you here right now.

45:01.646 --> 45:03.479
Be my surveillance partner.

45:06.521 --> 45:07.729
That's an order.

45:12.229 --> 45:13.146
Yes, sir.

45:17.354 --> 45:17.896
Brother,

45:18.646 --> 45:20.479
if Xin hadn't held the old man back,

45:20.812 --> 45:21.937
he would've stabbed me.

45:22.521 --> 45:23.562
He really meant to kill me.

45:31.937 --> 45:33.354
Is it really that good?

45:33.604 --> 45:35.062
It's just luncheon meat and egg noodles.

45:35.521 --> 45:37.437
Yours is much better than the diners'.

45:39.854 --> 45:41.854
When I was your age,

45:41.854 --> 45:43.562
all I thought about was

45:43.562 --> 45:45.729
how to stay alive on the battlefield.

45:48.937 --> 45:52.562
I envy that you boys can dream of anything

45:53.562 --> 45:54.729
and dare to dream anything.

45:55.687 --> 45:56.687
All I want

45:56.687 --> 45:58.312
is a life in peace

45:58.312 --> 45:59.604
with all my brothers together.

46:00.104 --> 46:01.396
Not scattered, like now.

46:03.021 --> 46:03.937
All these years,

46:04.312 --> 46:05.729
in order to look after me,

46:05.729 --> 46:08.854
you sacrificed spending time with your brothers.

46:10.187 --> 46:11.896
Since the day we met,

46:11.896 --> 46:13.021
you’ve been protecting me.

46:13.812 --> 46:16.021
When all those cops were after me,

46:16.021 --> 46:16.979
I couldn't believe

46:18.312 --> 46:20.396
a little beggar like you

46:21.521 --> 46:22.104
would save me.

46:24.354 --> 46:25.979
Then you risked your life

46:25.979 --> 46:27.354
to keep the bankrupt orphanage alive.

46:27.729 --> 46:28.521
Without you,

46:28.521 --> 46:30.271
we’d have starved to death.

46:36.854 --> 46:38.354
Eat mine, too.

46:43.521 --> 46:44.812
Out of all the kids,

46:44.812 --> 46:46.854
you’re the one I care about the most.

46:48.229 --> 46:49.979
Because you’re just like me.

46:51.687 --> 46:52.604
Simon is more like you.

46:56.021 --> 46:56.896
If that is so...

46:57.146 --> 46:59.229
He could be very dangerous.

47:06.854 --> 47:08.229
Eggy and Tofu,

47:08.229 --> 47:09.187
your date's over.

47:09.396 --> 47:10.396
Get changed and get to Point E.

47:12.104 --> 47:12.687
Pudding.

47:12.896 --> 47:13.979
Change.

47:13.979 --> 47:14.687
Point B.

47:18.021 --> 47:18.729
Pork Bun.

47:18.729 --> 47:19.437
Point A.

47:27.271 --> 47:29.604
Something's been feeling off lately.

47:30.229 --> 47:31.396
Stay away

47:31.396 --> 47:33.021
for a while.

47:33.021 --> 47:34.896
I can take care of myself.

48:08.354 --> 48:09.896
Come back to the car.

48:09.896 --> 48:10.812
Call the police.

48:13.521 --> 48:14.521
I am the police.

48:17.687 --> 48:18.771
Help.

48:19.729 --> 48:20.729
Leave them alone.

48:20.729 --> 48:21.604
Get lost.

48:23.146 --> 48:26.729
You're pretty cute, little missy.

48:43.062 --> 48:43.812
Who are you?

48:53.604 --> 48:54.312
Go.

49:03.729 --> 49:04.562
Let's go.

49:09.479 --> 49:10.104
Drive.

49:15.396 --> 49:16.021
Systems off.

49:20.729 --> 49:22.437
Do you know you're on a mission?

49:25.979 --> 49:27.479
Protecting civilians is a cop’s mission.

49:27.479 --> 49:28.521
At the right place

49:28.521 --> 49:29.229
and the right time.

49:30.521 --> 49:32.061
You're on an active mission.

49:32.061 --> 49:32.854
What's the mission?

49:32.854 --> 49:34.562
Operation Dinner for Officer Wong?

49:34.562 --> 49:35.979
Sorry, I failed the mission.

49:37.437 --> 49:38.479
Listen carefully.

49:38.479 --> 49:40.479
You are on a covert surveillance mission.

49:40.479 --> 49:42.937
You cannot blow your cover, no matter what.

49:43.271 --> 49:43.729
I didn't blow shit.

49:43.729 --> 49:44.604
You reached for your badge.

49:44.604 --> 49:45.854
If the Shadow saw that, it’s all over.

49:45.854 --> 49:47.437
And where is he?

49:48.604 --> 49:49.771
We’ve been wandering for weeks.

49:50.187 --> 49:51.437
It's time we actually do some real work.

49:51.437 --> 49:52.562
This is real work.

50:01.979 --> 50:02.854
It's only been two weeks.

50:03.562 --> 50:06.312
Do you know how long our longest mission was?

50:07.854 --> 50:08.562
Eight months.

50:12.854 --> 50:13.646
I know.

50:16.103 --> 50:16.729
Eight months.

50:18.104 --> 50:18.979
Then what?

50:21.354 --> 50:22.354
What happened?

50:23.021 --> 50:24.646
My father died because of you.

50:24.646 --> 50:25.729
The drug dealer escaped.

50:27.229 --> 50:28.396
Do you know I hadn't seen him

50:28.396 --> 50:30.396
for over a year before he died?!

50:48.021 --> 50:49.062
It was all my fault.

50:50.854 --> 50:51.479
I...

50:53.937 --> 50:55.479
You know what I did that day?

50:56.812 --> 50:58.104
I did what you did.

51:01.104 --> 51:02.937
What a cute kid.

51:03.604 --> 51:05.062
I have bubbles right here.

51:06.437 --> 51:07.271
Do you like bubbles?

51:07.271 --> 51:07.812
Yes

51:07.812 --> 51:09.687
Let's play in the van, shall we?

51:09.687 --> 51:11.187
We've got lots of toys inside.

51:11.187 --> 51:11.979
Shall we?

51:23.646 --> 51:24.062
What?

51:24.062 --> 51:25.312
-Put the kid down. -Get lost.

51:25.729 --> 51:26.437
Who are you?

51:26.437 --> 51:28.021
Put the kid down.

51:28.354 --> 51:28.937
Police.

51:30.687 --> 51:31.271
Don't move.

51:32.354 --> 51:33.396
So what?

51:33.396 --> 51:34.187
Don't you move.

51:34.604 --> 51:36.312
Let’s see your badge.

51:36.312 --> 51:37.271
Police.

52:06.187 --> 52:07.521
My recklessness

52:08.229 --> 52:09.854
got your father killed.

52:16.312 --> 52:17.937
But you saved that child.

52:19.146 --> 52:19.979
I didn't.

52:21.854 --> 52:23.771
The traffickers escaped in the chaos.

52:28.021 --> 52:29.896
Did they ever find the child?

52:32.979 --> 52:33.729
I don't know.

52:45.979 --> 52:47.937
As police officers,

52:47.937 --> 52:50.812
we have to learn to stay rational.

52:50.812 --> 52:51.896
Follow discipline.

52:52.771 --> 52:53.854
Execute orders.

52:56.271 --> 52:57.604
Better to have regrets

53:00.396 --> 53:01.604
than to make mistakes.

53:03.896 --> 53:05.354
Because that's our duty.

53:56.979 --> 53:57.896
Possible sighting of the Shadow.

53:57.896 --> 53:59.062
Mercado Rua de Oeste.

53:59.604 --> 54:00.604
Blue sweater jacket.

54:00.604 --> 54:01.396
Grey pants.

54:01.396 --> 54:02.062
Wearing a brown beret.

54:02.062 --> 54:03.104
Could be wearing glasses.

54:03.687 --> 54:05.146
Everyone, change outfits.

54:05.146 --> 54:05.937
Prepare to ID him.

54:09.521 --> 54:11.812
All units, be advised.

54:11.812 --> 54:13.146
Shadow spotted.

54:13.312 --> 54:14.146
Monitoring the market.

54:14.854 --> 54:16.437
Adorable Unit en route.

54:16.646 --> 54:18.521
Alpaca, Potsticker, east.

54:18.521 --> 54:19.979
Eggy, Tofu, west.

54:19.979 --> 54:21.396
Lucky, Rice Roll, south.

54:21.396 --> 54:22.646
Pudding, Pork Bun, north.

54:22.646 --> 54:24.479
The Shadow may have seen you before.

54:24.479 --> 54:26.604
A pro like him doesn't forget.

54:26.604 --> 54:28.062
He'll be vigilant the second time

54:28.062 --> 54:29.229
and get suspicious.

54:29.229 --> 54:30.646
Maintain a two-unit distance.

54:31.937 --> 54:32.646
Piggy.

54:36.229 --> 54:38.104
ID him up close.

54:39.354 --> 54:40.479
He hasn't seen your face.

54:41.521 --> 54:43.771
Small suggestion for ground surveillance.

54:43.771 --> 54:46.146
You should use your most inconspicuous officers.

54:46.146 --> 54:48.229
Preferably ones suspects haven't seen before.

54:53.937 --> 54:54.604
Go.

55:12.854 --> 55:14.271
Slow down.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.271
Maintain distance.

55:19.187 --> 55:20.604
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

55:20.604 --> 55:22.312
Adorable Unit's on site.

55:22.979 --> 55:23.812
Alpaca.

55:23.812 --> 55:25.437
Approach the fruit stall on the west.

55:30.187 --> 55:31.062
Walk slowly.

55:31.271 --> 55:32.186
Don't rush.

55:33.104 --> 55:35.479
Our mission is to ID the target.

55:35.479 --> 55:37.229
Don't spook the Shadow.

55:39.396 --> 55:41.354
Relax. Be natural.

55:42.312 --> 55:43.271
He's a pro.

55:43.271 --> 55:44.604
No room for negligence.

55:48.812 --> 55:49.896
Potsticker, east exit.

55:49.896 --> 55:50.646
Copy.

55:50.646 --> 55:52.396
Pork Bun, stand by at the footbridge.

55:52.396 --> 55:53.146
Copy.

55:58.562 --> 55:59.812
Pudding, don't get too close.

56:00.229 --> 56:00.979
Walk away.

56:02.271 --> 56:02.854
Alpaca.

56:03.312 --> 56:04.562
Can you ID him?

56:06.229 --> 56:07.271
Negative.

56:07.271 --> 56:08.396
Can't see his face.

56:08.396 --> 56:09.312
Can't confirm.

56:15.896 --> 56:17.396
We may be able to see his face.

56:23.937 --> 56:26.104
Eggy, Shadow might've seen you at Aoxing.

56:27.104 --> 56:27.812
Don’t turn.

56:37.896 --> 56:39.312
Tofu, well done.

56:39.312 --> 56:40.687
Piggy, it's on you.

56:45.521 --> 56:46.562
Be careful.

56:53.229 --> 56:54.937
I'll get closer to him.

57:00.146 --> 57:01.812
Piggy, you might get blown.

57:01.812 --> 57:03.146
I know. I have an idea.

57:37.896 --> 57:38.562
It’s him.

57:38.937 --> 57:39.604
Confirmed.

57:40.646 --> 57:41.896
Hand down.

57:50.729 --> 57:51.687
Don't move the camera.

58:08.479 --> 58:10.229
All units, positive ID on the Shadow.

58:11.146 --> 58:12.521
Adorable Unit, change and stand by.

58:12.521 --> 58:13.437
Maintain cover.

58:14.187 --> 58:15.687
Everyone, good job.

58:18.521 --> 58:20.854
Target confirmed.

58:20.854 --> 58:24.062
All units, do not breach 3 blocks perimeter.

58:24.062 --> 58:24.896
I repeat.

58:24.896 --> 58:26.729
Do not approach target area.

58:26.729 --> 58:28.687
Be advised, no siren.

58:33.771 --> 58:35.104
The target has entered a blind spot.

58:37.979 --> 58:39.521
Lucky, you're up.

58:40.687 --> 58:41.979
Potsticker, tail him.

58:43.396 --> 58:44.646
Not too close.

58:46.021 --> 58:47.479
The bastard won't get away.

58:50.146 --> 58:52.021
Shadow's headed to Changning Apartments.

58:53.937 --> 58:55.021
The blocks are connected inside.

58:55.021 --> 58:56.062
There are hundreds of flats.

58:56.354 --> 58:57.687
If we don't get his flat number,

58:57.687 --> 58:58.979
there won't be a next time.

59:12.604 --> 59:14.521
The Shadow's in Block C, Unit 1.

59:14.521 --> 59:15.604
No camera inside the building.

59:15.604 --> 59:17.062
We'll lose him in an elevator.

59:17.396 --> 59:18.187
Pull over.

59:18.187 --> 59:18.729
Adorables.

59:18.729 --> 59:19.562
They are too far away.

59:19.562 --> 59:20.437
Adorable unit, come in.

59:20.437 --> 59:22.146
I'm too far away to catch up.

59:22.146 --> 59:23.312
Potsticker cannot follow.

59:23.312 --> 59:24.937
Eggy cannot follow.

59:24.937 --> 59:25.646
I’ll go.

59:25.646 --> 59:26.646
Piggy can follow.

59:30.146 --> 59:30.896
I'm in.

01:00:48.354 --> 01:00:49.521
Top floor.

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:06.896
What are you doing?

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:07.979
Will you listen to me or not?

01:01:08.312 --> 01:01:09.187
What?

01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:10.229
Dating behind my back.

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:11.771
My friend caught you, you know.

01:01:17.937 --> 01:01:18.979
What floor?

01:01:20.687 --> 01:01:21.646
I forgot something.

01:01:21.937 --> 01:01:22.771
You two go ahead.

01:01:40.729 --> 01:01:42.021
Getting all dolled up now?

01:01:42.521 --> 01:01:44.479
I knew you'd lose your earrings

01:01:44.479 --> 01:01:45.229
with those big earphones on.

01:01:45.229 --> 01:01:46.437
Com'on, leave me alone.

01:01:48.812 --> 01:01:49.562
See this?

01:01:49.771 --> 01:01:51.937
They stop listening when they grow up.

01:01:52.354 --> 01:01:53.979
All they do is go against their parents.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:58.896
They're grown-ups with minds of their own.

01:02:00.479 --> 01:02:01.646
What can a father do?

01:02:02.354 --> 01:02:03.604
You're terribly open-minded.

01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:05.437
Otherwise, they’ll start

01:02:05.437 --> 01:02:07.062
hiding things from you.

01:02:14.604 --> 01:02:17.521
Your Aunt Kandam said that guy looks like an alpaca.

01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:18.687
Is that why you’re hiding him from me?

01:02:19.146 --> 01:02:19.896
Who?

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:21.937
The guy you’re dating.

01:02:22.646 --> 01:02:24.312
What's wrong with looking like a alpaca?

01:02:24.312 --> 01:02:25.604
Alpacas are cute.

01:02:26.354 --> 01:02:28.062
He’s actually really handsome, okay?

01:02:29.729 --> 01:02:30.979
That's been sitting for days.

01:02:30.979 --> 01:02:31.562
Why'd you buy it?

01:02:31.562 --> 01:02:32.979
Got a camera signal.

01:02:32.979 --> 01:02:34.354
It's all the same in the stomach.

01:02:35.729 --> 01:02:36.187
Here.

01:02:36.604 --> 01:02:37.187
Want one?

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:43.812
Check his background.

01:02:43.812 --> 01:02:44.312
Roger that.

01:02:44.312 --> 01:02:45.854
Shadow's face acquired.

01:02:45.854 --> 01:02:46.771
Caught on camera.

01:02:48.146 --> 01:02:49.479
How can you just spit that out?

01:02:50.687 --> 01:02:51.687
The janitors will clean it up.

01:02:52.312 --> 01:02:53.354
Look, it's fine.

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.396
I hope you’ll marry into

01:02:56.771 --> 01:02:58.396
a rich family someday.

01:02:58.646 --> 01:03:00.021
Ever seen a rich father-in-law

01:03:00.021 --> 01:03:01.604
behave this uncivilized?

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:05.979
One bad apple can't drag a family down.

01:03:05.979 --> 01:03:07.646
Will you be better to yourself?

01:03:07.646 --> 01:03:09.104
Buy some fresh fruits.

01:03:09.479 --> 01:03:11.604
I'm saving up for you.

01:03:11.604 --> 01:03:12.687
Not again.

01:03:16.937 --> 01:03:17.604
Bye.

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:28.771
So who's courting who now?

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:29.771
None of your business.

01:03:30.604 --> 01:03:31.687
You have such a bad temper.

01:03:32.229 --> 01:03:33.437
What does he see in you?

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:36.021
Keep walking.

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:36.687
Keep walking.

01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:38.812
I have a great temper.

01:03:39.979 --> 01:03:40.896
Now what?

01:03:41.271 --> 01:03:42.187
Follow me.

01:03:42.187 --> 01:03:43.396
What's his zodiac?

01:03:43.396 --> 01:03:44.687
What's it to you?

01:03:45.437 --> 01:03:46.812
To see if he is compatiable with me.

01:03:47.812 --> 01:03:48.687
You're not serious.

01:03:48.812 --> 01:03:49.521
Get the package.

01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:51.187
I'm amazed how nosy you can be.

01:03:56.021 --> 01:03:57.104
You buy so much stuff.

01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:09.771
Police.

01:04:11.229 --> 01:04:11.937
Close the door.

01:04:12.062 --> 01:04:13.562
We need this flat, please move out.

01:04:13.562 --> 01:04:14.479
Police business.

01:04:19.729 --> 01:04:20.229
Eighth floor.

01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:40.687
802, got it.

01:04:40.979 --> 01:04:42.687
Shadow lives in Channing apartment,

01:04:42.687 --> 01:04:46.729
C block, unit 1, 802. Solid intel.

01:05:17.312 --> 01:05:17.896
Pick it up.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:38.146
What's that sound?

01:05:38.146 --> 01:05:39.562
Popping bubble wrap?

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:40.687
Is it OCD?

01:05:52.521 --> 01:05:53.646
It's unsolvable.

01:05:54.021 --> 01:05:55.062
No wonder it's torn.

01:06:00.104 --> 01:06:01.104
Weird.

01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:02.896
They’re all wrong.

01:06:28.687 --> 01:06:30.604
In the past, the Shadow would always

01:06:30.604 --> 01:06:32.771
disappear after a job

01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:34.646
and remains silent for a while.

01:06:34.646 --> 01:06:35.771
He's a man of principle.

01:06:36.896 --> 01:06:38.521
This time, he broke his own protocol.

01:06:39.354 --> 01:06:40.146
What's happening?

01:06:41.354 --> 01:06:42.437
If I’m not mistaken,

01:06:43.687 --> 01:06:45.062
my guess is

01:06:45.062 --> 01:06:46.104
we've spooked him.

01:06:47.312 --> 01:06:48.354
Whatever he wants to play,

01:06:49.146 --> 01:06:49.979
we'll play with him.

01:06:58.271 --> 01:06:59.646
Finally stopped buying rotten apples?

01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:01.271
What a coincidence.

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:05.479
How much?

01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:07.312
$3.70.

01:07:08.354 --> 01:07:09.021
Prices have gone up.

01:07:09.937 --> 01:07:10.479
It's all right.

01:07:11.146 --> 01:07:11.521
Twenty cents.

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:13.812
Everything's more expensive now.

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:14.437
This one.

01:07:14.437 --> 01:07:15.021
Thanks.

01:07:18.229 --> 01:07:19.104
That stall is cheaper.

01:07:20.479 --> 01:07:22.437
Are you joking? They're terrible.

01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:23.187
Nothing fresh.

01:07:25.729 --> 01:07:26.812
I meant

01:07:26.812 --> 01:07:28.271
the fish stall behind it.

01:07:28.687 --> 01:07:29.187
It's cheap.

01:07:30.062 --> 01:07:30.646
You're right.

01:07:31.896 --> 01:07:32.812
Not to mention

01:07:32.812 --> 01:07:34.437
the owner's dad is a good man.

01:07:34.937 --> 01:07:35.771
Ten dollars.

01:07:36.729 --> 01:07:37.771
It's unfortunate

01:07:38.896 --> 01:07:40.104
how sudden he passed.

01:07:40.104 --> 01:07:40.937
Heart attack.

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:42.729
Asthma.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:47.812
Your daughter’s all grown up.

01:07:47.812 --> 01:07:49.021
Doesn’t she want to move out?

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:52.187
Her mom left me because of my gambling.

01:07:52.187 --> 01:07:53.354
After her mom

01:07:53.354 --> 01:07:54.521
died from illness,

01:07:55.396 --> 01:07:56.854
she moved in with me.

01:07:58.562 --> 01:07:59.187
Thanks.

01:08:01.146 --> 01:08:02.187
What are you doing?

01:08:02.187 --> 01:08:03.812
Planning to work in a casino?

01:08:03.812 --> 01:08:05.104
Selling fish doesn't pay the bills

01:08:05.104 --> 01:08:05.854
Give me a grass carp.

01:08:08.354 --> 01:08:09.854
See these calluses?

01:08:10.979 --> 01:08:13.104
Got them from playing cards when I was young.

01:08:13.104 --> 01:08:14.562
I wanted to be a God of Gamblers.

01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:15.979
I didn't know

01:08:15.979 --> 01:08:17.353
that was only in the movies.

01:08:18.521 --> 01:08:19.603
I thought

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.146
you got callus from holding guns.

01:08:22.146 --> 01:08:23.521
Never held a gun.

01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.728
Held a chef's knife for 10 years, though.

01:08:27.271 --> 01:08:28.103
Let's find a time.

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:28.978
I'll cook a few dishes.

01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:30.937
Come over

01:08:30.937 --> 01:08:31.853
and have a drink.

01:08:33.521 --> 01:08:34.187
That's funny.

01:08:34.896 --> 01:08:36.978
I was a chef when I was abroad.

01:08:36.978 --> 01:08:38.478
My teacher was from Hangzhou.

01:08:38.478 --> 01:08:40.228
I make a mean West Lake vinegar fish.

01:08:41.396 --> 01:08:43.396
How about today?

01:08:46.187 --> 01:08:46.603
Great.

01:08:47.353 --> 01:08:49.228
I happen to have a bottle of Chilean wine

01:08:49.896 --> 01:08:50.853
that goes with that dish.

01:08:51.896 --> 01:08:53.353
You bring the wine, I'll cook.

01:08:57.978 --> 01:08:58.687
Come in.

01:08:59.062 --> 01:08:59.853
Have a seat.

01:09:00.478 --> 01:09:01.396
I'll put this into the fridge.

01:09:09.853 --> 01:09:10.812
What was he doing?

01:09:10.812 --> 01:09:11.937
Checking for dust.

01:09:11.937 --> 01:09:13.312
To see if they just moved in.

01:09:17.771 --> 01:09:18.437
You're not getting away.

01:09:19.103 --> 01:09:20.353
You may be the guest,

01:09:20.353 --> 01:09:21.812
but you're not spared from kitchen duty.

01:09:22.562 --> 01:09:23.312
Show us what you've got.

01:09:24.978 --> 01:09:25.603
I can't wait.

01:09:27.728 --> 01:09:29.103
How long were you a chef for?

01:09:29.896 --> 01:09:30.771
Over ten years.

01:09:32.436 --> 01:09:33.603
And that's the knife you use?

01:09:53.521 --> 01:09:54.687
You know your knives.

01:09:55.062 --> 01:09:56.021
I just like

01:09:56.687 --> 01:09:57.896
doing things the right way.

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:00.854
Got any kids?

01:10:02.354 --> 01:10:03.646
I'm on my own.

01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:04.771
A lonely old man.

01:10:05.896 --> 01:10:07.437
Here's a home-cooked meal.

01:10:11.437 --> 01:10:13.437
Your girl seems like a smart kid.

01:10:13.937 --> 01:10:15.521
That scar on her forehead...

01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:16.437
How'd she get it?

01:10:25.604 --> 01:10:27.146
Put that phone away.

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:28.146
Talk with our guest instead.

01:10:28.146 --> 01:10:28.771
Okay.

01:10:29.646 --> 01:10:30.604
I need the bathroom.

01:10:35.771 --> 01:10:37.354
If I had a child,

01:10:37.771 --> 01:10:41.271
I'd ban phones from the dinner table, too.

01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:46.187
Start coloning.

01:10:46.604 --> 01:10:48.562
What are you studying?

01:10:48.562 --> 01:10:49.104
Nursing.

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:51.437
You plan to be a nurse after graduation?

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:55.354
Maybe in a retirement home.

01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:57.604
What a kind heart.

01:11:01.062 --> 01:11:02.646
How'd you get that scar?

01:11:02.896 --> 01:11:03.479
This one?

01:11:06.604 --> 01:11:08.187
Fifth grade.

01:11:08.812 --> 01:11:10.604
Got into a fight with some girls.

01:11:11.687 --> 01:11:13.146
Why were you fighting?

01:11:13.146 --> 01:11:14.479
A classmate was being bullied.

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:15.604
Couldn't stand idly by.

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.354
But I never told anyone that until now.

01:11:21.104 --> 01:11:22.562
Does your dad know?

01:11:22.562 --> 01:11:24.062
He couldn’t possibly know.

01:11:25.479 --> 01:11:26.854
That’s odd.

01:11:27.937 --> 01:11:28.729
What’s up?

01:11:30.396 --> 01:11:32.646
How'd she get that scar again?

01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:35.771
She got into a fight in fifth grade.

01:11:35.771 --> 01:11:36.604
One against five.

01:11:36.604 --> 01:11:38.354
Someone bashed her with a bottle.

01:11:42.396 --> 01:11:44.062
I never told anyone.

01:11:45.604 --> 01:11:46.854
Not even my mom.

01:11:47.979 --> 01:11:49.104
You didn’t tell her because

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:50.271
you didn't want her to worry.

01:11:50.812 --> 01:11:51.729
Even your teacher

01:11:51.729 --> 01:11:53.104
thought you hit a door.

01:11:53.396 --> 01:11:54.062
Right?

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.562
How'd you know, then?

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.062
After our divorce,

01:12:07.187 --> 01:12:08.187
my debts

01:12:08.979 --> 01:12:10.146
made me some enemies.

01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:13.146
I was worried they'd hurt you.

01:12:16.937 --> 01:12:17.729
The truth is...

01:12:19.562 --> 01:12:20.729
I was always nearby.

01:12:29.771 --> 01:12:30.479
See?

01:12:33.187 --> 01:12:34.354
That's a dad.

01:12:41.187 --> 01:12:42.437
Then why didn’t you help me?

01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:44.187
Help you?

01:12:44.187 --> 01:12:45.979
Remember what you did to those girls?

01:12:45.979 --> 01:12:47.021
It's horrifying.

01:12:47.021 --> 01:12:48.604
I was too scared to step in.

01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:50.646
Give me some credit.

01:12:50.646 --> 01:12:51.729
I was standing up for someone.

01:12:51.729 --> 01:12:52.229
You were...

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.979
What?

01:12:52.979 --> 01:12:53.979
You were committing murder.

01:12:53.979 --> 01:12:55.187
Com'on now.

01:12:56.437 --> 01:12:58.104
You're embarrassing me.

01:13:17.646 --> 01:13:18.271
How'd it go?

01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.812
Go on.

01:13:27.562 --> 01:13:28.187
Thank you.

01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:30.187
What for?

01:13:32.436 --> 01:13:33.812
For protecting us.

01:13:41.937 --> 01:13:42.896
Some things

01:13:44.271 --> 01:13:45.812
can never be mended.

01:13:48.354 --> 01:13:50.312
The only thing I could do for your father

01:13:52.437 --> 01:13:53.562
was to watch over you.

01:13:56.271 --> 01:13:58.146
I know you've been worrying about me.

01:13:59.854 --> 01:14:00.812
You want to protect me.

01:14:03.937 --> 01:14:05.396
But I’ve grown up.

01:14:07.479 --> 01:14:08.479
I'll be okay.

01:14:13.812 --> 01:14:14.812
You're okay.

01:14:17.729 --> 01:14:18.479
Big Brother...

01:14:18.771 --> 01:14:19.771
If you fail,

01:14:20.146 --> 01:14:21.187
what happens next

01:14:21.187 --> 01:14:22.271
will be my call.

01:14:23.187 --> 01:14:24.729
If we do it your way,

01:14:24.729 --> 01:14:26.229
there's no turning back for us.

01:14:26.854 --> 01:14:28.021
I just want to

01:14:28.979 --> 01:14:30.312
do things the right way.

01:14:37.187 --> 01:14:38.146
They have anti-tracking.

01:14:38.146 --> 01:14:39.354
Must be that hacker.

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:40.021
Stand down.

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.146
Have you checked their background?

01:14:48.146 --> 01:14:48.937
I have.

01:14:53.396 --> 01:14:53.896
Guoguo?

01:14:53.896 --> 01:14:54.771
Forgot something?

01:15:05.562 --> 01:15:06.729
Nothing to worry about.

01:15:07.687 --> 01:15:09.104
Maybe I did worry too much.

01:15:15.896 --> 01:15:17.104
Did you

01:15:17.104 --> 01:15:18.229
sense something's off?

01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:41.354
I realize that

01:15:42.187 --> 01:15:43.146
you're a big boy now.

01:15:43.896 --> 01:15:45.187
It really is time to let go.

01:16:21.979 --> 01:16:23.646
Let's follow through with your plan.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:24.729
Got it.

01:16:25.312 --> 01:16:26.146
You know what you're doing?

01:16:31.979 --> 01:16:32.812
I do.

01:17:22.854 --> 01:17:24.479
That girl isn't Guoguo.

01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:25.562
What do you mean?

01:17:25.896 --> 01:17:27.354
There’s something wrong with this feed.

01:17:27.354 --> 01:17:28.896
That’s definitely not Qiuguo.

01:17:33.812 --> 01:17:34.937
Send backup to Wong.

01:17:34.937 --> 01:17:35.729
He's in danger.

01:17:36.854 --> 01:17:38.062
Cops are coming, leave.

01:18:10.396 --> 01:18:11.187
I failed.

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:12.896
I'll find another way.

01:18:35.646 --> 01:18:36.271
Hey.

01:18:36.771 --> 01:18:37.854
Has the Shadow moved?

01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:40.396
Nope, all quiet.

01:18:46.646 --> 01:18:48.687
You had your chance, Xiwang.

01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:54.521
Those boys

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:56.354
didn’t even tell the Shadow

01:18:56.354 --> 01:18:57.396
that he’s being watched.

01:18:59.479 --> 01:19:02.229
They know we'd use the Shadow to track them,

01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:03.354
so we wouldn't touch him.

01:19:09.604 --> 01:19:11.479
Killing me and creating chaos

01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:14.146
would've created an opening to break The Shadow out.

01:19:14.687 --> 01:19:15.937
After failing this time,

01:19:15.937 --> 01:19:17.437
they'll look for another chance.

01:19:21.812 --> 01:19:24.146
Their chance is our opportunity, too.

01:19:24.146 --> 01:19:25.854
We have to nail this gang of thieves

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:26.854
once for all.

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:52.562
Shadow's on the move.

01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:11.521
Surveillance team, spread out.

01:20:13.854 --> 01:20:17.146
Madam, that's the same taxi as the one at Aoxing.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.146
Sending photo to the surveillance team now.

01:20:19.146 --> 01:20:20.271
We’re standing by.

01:20:20.271 --> 01:20:21.562
When the suspects' location is locked,

01:20:21.562 --> 01:20:22.604
we're ready to move in.

01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:29.729
Target vehicle is approaching our HQ.

01:20:29.729 --> 01:20:31.562
Are they turning themselves in?

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:33.854
Doesn’t look like it.

01:20:41.146 --> 01:20:41.854
Wait.

01:20:42.562 --> 01:20:44.229
Show me that cabinet again.

01:20:50.771 --> 01:20:52.354
Why is that still there?

01:20:55.271 --> 01:20:56.729
It's unsolvable.

01:20:57.271 --> 01:20:58.437
They're all wrong.

01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:04.062
Get closer, show me again.

01:21:11.979 --> 01:21:12.771
What’s that?

01:21:12.771 --> 01:21:14.729
It seems Wong's van has been hit.

01:21:42.354 --> 01:21:42.979
Officer Wong?

01:21:43.354 --> 01:21:44.396
Wong, can you hear me?

01:21:44.812 --> 01:21:45.896
Wong, come in if you hear me.

01:21:46.854 --> 01:21:47.479
Officer Wong?

01:21:47.854 --> 01:21:48.437
Officer Wong?

01:21:48.771 --> 01:21:49.604
Officer Wong?

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:50.229
Guoguo.

01:21:50.562 --> 01:21:51.021
Their...

01:21:51.021 --> 01:21:52.437
Their vehicles broke in.

01:21:52.979 --> 01:21:53.812
Whose vehicles?

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:06.187
HQ is under attack?

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:07.354
Madam, what's going on?

01:22:15.729 --> 01:22:16.353
Du Ping,

01:22:16.353 --> 01:22:17.437
ready the mobile command unit.

01:22:17.437 --> 01:22:17.771
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:17.979 --> 01:22:19.104
Surveillance, stay focused.

01:22:19.104 --> 01:22:20.104
Eyes on target.

01:22:20.104 --> 01:22:21.187
Watch the Shadow's every move.

01:22:29.437 --> 01:22:30.104
Officer Wong.

01:22:33.979 --> 01:22:35.521
Someone's still alive.

01:22:35.854 --> 01:22:36.521
Terminate.

01:23:14.771 --> 01:23:15.437
The phone...

01:23:16.312 --> 01:23:17.062
It's smashed.

01:23:17.062 --> 01:23:18.687
The key to the puzzle isn't the numbers.

01:23:18.687 --> 01:23:19.437
it’s the positions.

01:23:19.437 --> 01:23:20.604
They’re using Braille.

01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:22.104
The bubble wrap is also Braille.

01:23:22.104 --> 01:23:24.312
Get Intelligence to decipher the messages.

01:23:24.312 --> 01:23:26.354
Find out what they're up to.

01:23:33.021 --> 01:23:34.354
Find a phone, I'll hold them back.

01:23:34.354 --> 01:23:34.937
Go.

01:23:43.687 --> 01:23:44.604
What's this place?

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:46.854
Looks like an abandoned orphanage.

01:23:46.854 --> 01:23:48.146
No other suspect in sight.

01:23:51.021 --> 01:23:52.229
Use thermal to follow Shadow.

01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:53.521
I need eyes on the inside.

01:24:05.896 --> 01:24:06.479
Captain.

01:24:06.771 --> 01:24:07.396
In the orphanage!

01:24:12.562 --> 01:24:13.146
HQ.

01:24:13.354 --> 01:24:13.729
This is Alpaca.

01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:14.687
Can anyone hear me?

01:24:15.937 --> 01:24:16.729
Command central?

01:24:17.312 --> 01:24:18.312
We've lost all comms.

01:24:18.312 --> 01:24:19.104
Command central?

01:24:47.437 --> 01:24:49.354
Brothers, get to work.

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.646
Chop him up.

01:25:52.812 --> 01:25:55.187
Do you know how many cops came after me?

01:25:56.104 --> 01:25:56.896
Two hundred.

01:25:57.729 --> 01:25:58.812
If I took off,

01:25:59.146 --> 01:26:00.396
I’d be dead for sure.

01:26:00.729 --> 01:26:02.146
So what did you do?

01:26:02.937 --> 01:26:04.896
The idiot who got nailed

01:26:04.896 --> 01:26:06.146
became bait.

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.812
Then I took out the biggest threat

01:26:09.812 --> 01:26:11.271
in the Police Force.

01:26:12.854 --> 01:26:15.937
That took out the cops' eyes.

01:26:18.521 --> 01:26:21.354
Then I took out the idiot,

01:26:23.687 --> 01:26:25.604
cutting off the cops' ears, too.

01:26:27.521 --> 01:26:30.187
I've become the idiot in my boys' eyes.

01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:35.229
However...

01:26:36.021 --> 01:26:38.521
first you need to be sure to have

01:26:39.771 --> 01:26:40.604
what it takes.

01:26:42.979 --> 01:26:43.979
You're a big boy now.

01:26:45.521 --> 01:26:46.437
You know what you're doing?

01:26:49.812 --> 01:26:51.187
Who do you think I am?

01:26:51.687 --> 01:26:52.646
Kill him.

01:27:06.771 --> 01:27:08.229
Cell signal's jammed.

01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:10.062
Find a sat phone to call for backup.

01:27:10.062 --> 01:27:11.229
We'll go buy some time.

01:27:41.104 --> 01:27:42.771
That's him.

01:27:42.979 --> 01:27:44.271
Gotta kill him to get paid.

01:28:13.937 --> 01:28:15.312
The Shadow sends messages via Braille.

01:28:15.312 --> 01:28:17.021
The bubble wrap and sudoku are all Braille.

01:28:17.021 --> 01:28:17.604
Guoguo.

01:28:17.604 --> 01:28:18.771
Give that intel to Madam Wang.

01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.646
Guoguo.

01:29:08.271 --> 01:29:11.146
How did the cops arrive so quickly?

01:29:35.979 --> 01:29:37.437
Madam, we've got this.

01:30:22.812 --> 01:30:23.646
Godfather.

01:30:28.271 --> 01:30:29.062
I failed.

01:30:29.437 --> 01:30:30.396
I'll find another way.

01:30:30.396 --> 01:30:32.104
You had your chance, Xiwang.

01:30:33.021 --> 01:30:35.771
If we're the ones nailed by the police,

01:30:35.771 --> 01:30:36.729
what would the old man do?

01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:38.854
This is no one's fault.

01:30:38.854 --> 01:30:39.562
It's just

01:30:40.271 --> 01:30:41.771
carelessness and bad luck.

01:30:43.937 --> 01:30:45.271
Simon’s idea?

01:30:45.604 --> 01:30:46.312
Mine.

01:30:58.979 --> 01:31:00.604
Still think you're not like me?

01:31:05.437 --> 01:31:05.979
Xiwang,

01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:07.062
what are you doing?

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:08.104
You don’t understand

01:31:08.562 --> 01:31:09.812
how dangerous this man is.

01:31:19.646 --> 01:31:20.562
Leave.

01:31:20.562 --> 01:31:21.771
This isn't part of the plan.

01:31:26.812 --> 01:31:28.896
The old man has to die here

01:31:28.896 --> 01:31:29.562
for you to be safe.

01:31:29.562 --> 01:31:30.312
Leave.

01:31:30.312 --> 01:31:31.937
This isn't part of the plan.

01:31:35.479 --> 01:31:37.396
This was always my plan.

01:31:42.062 --> 01:31:43.396
I'm helping you for the last time.

01:31:45.646 --> 01:31:46.646
You want to die?

01:31:46.646 --> 01:31:47.729
Simon's my little brother.

01:31:48.479 --> 01:31:49.187
If he screws up...

01:31:49.854 --> 01:31:50.771
It's my job to fix it.

01:31:51.062 --> 01:31:51.812
I have no choice.

01:31:55.854 --> 01:31:57.312
Then I'll send you on your way.

01:31:59.229 --> 01:32:00.979
Godfather.

01:32:02.937 --> 01:32:03.896
Your life

01:32:04.854 --> 01:32:06.271
ends here too.

01:33:25.896 --> 01:33:27.062
Get ready.

01:34:47.146 --> 01:34:48.146
He’s a wolf.

01:34:48.812 --> 01:34:50.437
We’re wolf pups.

01:34:53.437 --> 01:34:54.437
He's our father.

01:34:58.271 --> 01:34:59.729
In my next life,

01:35:02.604 --> 01:35:04.521
I hope I'll be your real son.

01:36:08.479 --> 01:36:10.396
Take care of them.

01:36:10.396 --> 01:36:12.104
Look after their families.

01:36:13.979 --> 01:36:14.812
Yes, sir.

01:36:31.146 --> 01:36:32.479
Kandam, it's me.

01:36:35.354 --> 01:36:35.854
Gundam.

01:36:35.854 --> 01:36:36.521
Like the robot.

01:36:36.521 --> 01:36:37.437
What do we know?

01:36:38.896 --> 01:36:40.062
I just contacted Captain Wu.

01:36:40.062 --> 01:36:41.312
A big explosion at the orphanage.

01:36:41.521 --> 01:36:42.062
The Shadow?

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:42.979
Not sure.

01:36:43.187 --> 01:36:44.687
But we've ID'd the assailants.

01:36:44.687 --> 01:36:45.604
On the surface,

01:36:45.604 --> 01:36:47.187
they're private security

01:36:47.187 --> 01:36:49.229
for VIP clients at casinos.

01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:50.604
But they also moonlight as mercenaries,

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.437
taking high-risk jobs on the dark web.

01:36:52.812 --> 01:36:54.437
Alpaca contacted Evidence

01:36:54.437 --> 01:36:55.562
after receiving Piggy's message.

01:36:55.562 --> 01:36:57.354
We'll have the results soon, thanks to him.

01:37:01.021 --> 01:37:02.146
It's Gordon D.

01:37:04.479 --> 01:37:06.271
Why is Duan's HK$10 billion

01:37:06.271 --> 01:37:07.854
in the police station's server?

01:37:07.854 --> 01:37:09.146
Without the decryption keys,

01:37:09.146 --> 01:37:11.521
the loot can only be kept as digital evidence.

01:37:11.521 --> 01:37:12.771
The only way to access the cold wallet

01:37:12.771 --> 01:37:13.604
is by using its digital key,

01:37:13.604 --> 01:37:14.812
enabling the 12-word passphrase

01:37:14.812 --> 01:37:17.354
to be inputted with nanosecond precision.

01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:19.437
They were here.

01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:23.479
Madam,

01:37:23.479 --> 01:37:24.479
leave this to us.

01:37:24.646 --> 01:37:25.521
Be careful.

01:37:28.562 --> 01:37:29.812
We have a report of a robbery.

01:37:29.812 --> 01:37:30.812
Suspects just left.

01:37:30.812 --> 01:37:32.771
Four males, all in early 20s.

01:37:34.479 --> 01:37:36.187
It was those SWAT guys just now.

01:37:36.646 --> 01:37:37.854
The perps cut the power to

01:37:37.854 --> 01:37:40.104
stop us from shutting the hacker out remotely.

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:42.354
They need a local network

01:37:42.354 --> 01:37:43.979
within range to access the servers.

01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:45.312
What does that mean?

01:37:45.979 --> 01:37:47.437
The hacker was just here.

01:37:57.896 --> 01:37:58.979
We were wrong.

01:38:00.896 --> 01:38:02.229
What did we do wrong?

01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:04.062
The old man got himself caught.

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:06.687
Like an idiot.

01:38:07.312 --> 01:38:09.312
He was outsmarted by the cops.

01:38:12.187 --> 01:38:14.104
That cop’s house was too clean.

01:38:14.104 --> 01:38:15.146
It didn't even have a router.

01:38:15.146 --> 01:38:16.103
It was absurd.

01:38:17.146 --> 01:38:18.854
No way the old man didn't notice.

01:38:20.021 --> 01:38:21.729
But he still played along.

01:38:22.687 --> 01:38:24.312
What are you trying to say?

01:38:27.021 --> 01:38:27.896
I think

01:38:29.271 --> 01:38:30.896
he was actually throwing

01:38:30.896 --> 01:38:31.896
the cops off our trail.

01:38:33.562 --> 01:38:35.062
The 'Ghost Car' trap?

01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:40.646
He's not that noble.

01:38:41.062 --> 01:38:43.437
He's the most cunning,

01:38:44.062 --> 01:38:45.687
ruthless,

01:38:46.312 --> 01:38:47.187
and...

01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:54.146
He's a dad.

01:38:54.312 --> 01:38:55.312
He's a dad.

01:39:00.396 --> 01:39:01.437
Get a grip.

01:39:02.271 --> 01:39:03.271
Get away first.

01:39:03.854 --> 01:39:04.812
Then we'll cry.

01:39:35.771 --> 01:39:37.187
We lost a SWAT vehicle at

01:39:37.187 --> 01:39:39.062
the surveillance blind spot on Calcada do Carmo.

01:39:39.062 --> 01:39:40.937
It's likely the thieves will flee tonight.

01:39:40.937 --> 01:39:42.271
Watch every possible exit route

01:39:42.271 --> 01:39:43.604
and all scheduled departures.

01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:44.687
Every route?

01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:45.729
That'll take time.

01:39:45.729 --> 01:39:46.937
We don’t have time.

01:39:47.187 --> 01:39:47.896
What do we do now?

01:39:49.687 --> 01:39:50.687
Activate S.P.A.I.S.,

01:39:50.937 --> 01:39:52.771
restore analysis and command authority.

01:39:53.521 --> 01:39:54.187
Copy.

01:39:54.896 --> 01:39:56.854
Have her study the thieves' past MO

01:39:56.854 --> 01:39:58.646
and predict their next moves.

01:39:58.646 --> 01:40:00.812
Show her their most recent methods, too.

01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:02.271
If possible...

01:40:02.271 --> 01:40:02.771
Madam.

01:40:03.562 --> 01:40:04.271
Spice Girl's got a lead.

01:40:04.271 --> 01:40:04.937
That fast?

01:40:06.979 --> 01:40:10.104
The suspect vehicle disappeared on Calcada do Carmo.

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:11.062
Within a three-kilometer radius,

01:40:11.062 --> 01:40:13.312
a gray van was caught on cameras.

01:40:13.312 --> 01:40:15.021
There’s a 67% chance

01:40:15.021 --> 01:40:16.562
that the thieves switched to this van.

01:40:16.562 --> 01:40:18.562
There's an 82% chance the thieves are

01:40:18.562 --> 01:40:19.729
headed to the Wynn Palace.

01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:20.271
Wynn?

01:40:20.271 --> 01:40:21.312
The Wynn again?

01:40:21.646 --> 01:40:22.354
I told you to learn,

01:40:22.354 --> 01:40:23.146
not copy old answers.

01:40:25.687 --> 01:40:26.771
Don’t move.

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:27.146
Don’t move.

01:40:27.146 --> 01:40:27.646
Hands on your head.

01:40:27.646 --> 01:40:28.187
Don’t move.

01:40:28.187 --> 01:40:29.979
Don’t move.

01:40:30.937 --> 01:40:31.604
Put down the knife.

01:40:32.271 --> 01:40:32.979
Put down the knife.

01:40:32.979 --> 01:40:33.729
Put down the knife.

01:40:33.729 --> 01:40:34.854
- Put it down. -Put down the knife.

01:40:34.854 --> 01:40:35.604
Freeze.

01:40:41.562 --> 01:40:42.354
Ting.

01:40:43.812 --> 01:40:44.604
Ting.

01:40:47.104 --> 01:40:48.104
The Shadow's still alive.

01:40:48.104 --> 01:40:48.937
The Shadow's still alive.

01:40:49.687 --> 01:40:50.312
On your knees.

01:40:50.479 --> 01:40:51.396
Hands on your head.

01:40:51.396 --> 01:40:51.937
On your knees.

01:40:52.271 --> 01:40:53.396
Hands on your head.

01:40:53.396 --> 01:40:54.146
On your knees.

01:41:02.396 --> 01:41:03.604
Daddy.

01:41:12.854 --> 01:41:13.479
On your knees.

01:41:13.479 --> 01:41:14.229
Hands on your head.

01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:15.562
On your knees. Hands on your head.

01:41:15.812 --> 01:41:16.562
On your knees.

01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:22.479
Wynn Palace.

01:41:25.604 --> 01:41:26.937
Take me there.

01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:29.646
There’s someone you haven’t seen.

01:41:30.771 --> 01:41:32.271
I'll point him out.

01:41:37.521 --> 01:41:38.896
Spice Girl found a vehicle

01:41:38.896 --> 01:41:40.604
relevant to a possible exit route

01:41:40.604 --> 01:41:42.021
that leads to suspicious individuals.

01:41:42.021 --> 01:41:42.812
Suspicious in identities?

01:41:42.812 --> 01:41:43.396
No.

01:41:43.396 --> 01:41:44.062
In the number of them.

01:41:44.396 --> 01:41:45.354
The Wynn has an art exhibition.

01:41:45.354 --> 01:41:47.646
The paintings are flying back to Paris tonight.

01:41:47.646 --> 01:41:48.687
Six Chinese personnel were added

01:41:48.687 --> 01:41:50.687
to the manifest two days ago.

01:41:50.687 --> 01:41:52.104
And on the night of the last heist,

01:41:52.104 --> 01:41:53.979
Wynn also had art pieces set to leave.

01:41:54.146 --> 01:41:55.646
This Spice Girl's gifted.

01:42:16.437 --> 01:42:17.104
Cops are here.

01:42:17.396 --> 01:42:18.187
That's fast.

01:42:18.187 --> 01:42:19.187
Plan B.

01:42:48.687 --> 01:42:49.479
Doghead here.

01:42:49.479 --> 01:42:51.062
X Target may be in the laundry room.

01:42:51.437 --> 01:42:53.146
Piggy, laundry room south door.

01:42:53.146 --> 01:42:53.729
Get over there.

01:42:53.729 --> 01:42:54.271
Copy.

01:42:54.771 --> 01:42:56.062
What's Surveillance's ETA?

01:43:10.187 --> 01:43:11.646
Leave him to us, you go.

01:43:18.646 --> 01:43:19.271
Piggy.

01:43:19.771 --> 01:43:21.437
X Target has left the laundry room.

01:43:21.854 --> 01:43:22.854
Lil Puppy and Pretty Face

01:43:22.854 --> 01:43:23.979
are showing off their moves here.

01:43:24.354 --> 01:43:25.896
I'll have a chat with them.

01:43:26.187 --> 01:43:27.354
Try to get them to surrender.

01:43:27.646 --> 01:43:28.937
Surrender, my ass.

01:43:31.562 --> 01:43:32.521
Attention, all units.

01:43:32.521 --> 01:43:35.354
Wynn Palace South Lawn is packed with people.

01:43:35.354 --> 01:43:36.854
There seems to be an event tonight.

01:44:12.562 --> 01:44:13.312
Scratch that.

01:44:13.562 --> 01:44:14.937
It’s Mad Puppy and Psycho Puss.

01:44:34.146 --> 01:44:35.479
Piggy to Doghead.

01:44:35.479 --> 01:44:36.229
Go, Piggy.

01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:37.437
I'm at the party.

01:44:37.854 --> 01:44:39.062
I think he's here,

01:44:39.062 --> 01:44:39.896
but I can't find him.

01:44:40.104 --> 01:44:40.812
Stay calm.

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:43.312
Doghead to Animal Paradise.

01:44:43.312 --> 01:44:44.896
Use the Shadow's number to call him.

01:44:44.896 --> 01:44:45.562
A.I. voice imitation?

01:44:45.562 --> 01:44:46.812
Let the old man talk to them.

01:44:50.021 --> 01:44:50.604
Copy.

01:45:04.479 --> 01:45:05.312
Godfather?

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:11.729
Xiwang died for nothing.

01:45:16.521 --> 01:45:18.062
Tracing X Target's phone now.

01:45:18.062 --> 01:45:18.854
There is no anti-tracking.

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:20.021
He's not hiding anymore.

01:45:20.396 --> 01:45:20.979
Piggy.

01:45:21.146 --> 01:45:22.062
Focus.

01:45:22.896 --> 01:45:24.187
Observe people's reactions.

01:45:24.521 --> 01:45:25.104
Copy.

01:45:26.146 --> 01:45:26.937
Simon,

01:45:27.604 --> 01:45:28.854
the police are fishing for you.

01:45:30.312 --> 01:45:32.354
If the police catch you today,

01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:34.562
I'll be very disappointed.

01:45:35.812 --> 01:45:37.146
I may have disappointed you already.

01:45:40.354 --> 01:45:42.271
You had a good plan today.

01:45:42.937 --> 01:45:44.021
I like it.

01:45:44.687 --> 01:45:45.729
Thank you, Godfather.

01:45:45.729 --> 01:45:46.646
But...

01:45:46.646 --> 01:45:48.396
Anyone who knows what they're doing

01:45:49.062 --> 01:45:50.521
would finish things themselves.

01:45:52.104 --> 01:45:52.937
Noted.

01:45:56.187 --> 01:45:57.146
In this regard,

01:45:58.479 --> 01:46:00.646
Xiwang did a better job.

01:46:12.896 --> 01:46:15.271
I was really hoping you'd all be able

01:46:15.271 --> 01:46:17.604
to live the life you wanted.

01:46:30.062 --> 01:46:32.061
This is my last time helping you.

01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:38.812
Shadow was stalling on purpose.

01:46:38.812 --> 01:46:39.937
There is a chance to identify him

01:46:39.937 --> 01:46:40.896
if he tries to move.

01:46:41.521 --> 01:46:42.396
Piggy.

01:46:42.396 --> 01:46:44.521
Remember the key points of tracking?

01:46:44.521 --> 01:46:46.229
Find prominent and permanent features.

01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:47.312
It's okay if your memory's fuzzy.

01:46:48.937 --> 01:46:49.854
When you see those features,

01:46:49.854 --> 01:46:51.062
Your brain will kick in to help.

01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:34.396
I see him.

01:47:34.896 --> 01:47:35.687
He's...

01:47:37.271 --> 01:47:37.854
Hello?

01:47:55.896 --> 01:47:56.812
Let me out.

01:48:57.062 --> 01:48:57.479
Madam,

01:48:57.479 --> 01:48:58.687
Piggy's not answering,

01:48:58.687 --> 01:49:00.562
Potsticker and Tofu are on-site.

01:49:00.562 --> 01:49:02.271
We need X Target's features.

01:49:02.646 --> 01:49:03.646
Too many people at the party.

01:49:03.646 --> 01:49:05.229
Everyone looks like X Target to me now.

01:49:05.687 --> 01:49:07.937
Your X Target is 180 cm tall

01:49:07.937 --> 01:49:09.354
and weighs 68 kg.

01:49:09.354 --> 01:49:10.104
Long hair.

01:49:10.437 --> 01:49:11.604
That's Wu Yaolei's comms.

01:49:11.604 --> 01:49:13.312
He's sneaking into the VIP area.

01:49:14.021 --> 01:49:15.646
Animal Paradise, is the intel solid?

01:49:16.479 --> 01:49:17.187
Cut him off.

01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:22.812
Take my earpiece.

01:49:22.812 --> 01:49:23.687
I'll grab another from the car.

01:49:23.687 --> 01:49:24.396
Report your position.

01:49:24.396 --> 01:49:25.354
They're worried about you.

01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:27.312
Shadow just ID'd X Target.

01:49:27.312 --> 01:49:27.896
Don't worry.

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.521
Him and the driver are twins.

01:49:34.979 --> 01:49:36.354
Piggy to Animal Paradise.

01:49:36.687 --> 01:49:37.771
Sorry for making you worried.

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:38.687
I'm glad you're okay.

01:49:39.312 --> 01:49:40.104
Found anything?

01:49:40.104 --> 01:49:41.854
The target and the driver are twins.

01:49:47.354 --> 01:49:49.229
VIP area, I may have found him.

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:54.687
Who are you?

01:49:54.687 --> 01:49:55.271
Sorry.

01:49:59.771 --> 01:50:00.729
Should've never trusted Shadow.

01:50:00.729 --> 01:50:01.854
He had his reasons.

01:50:01.854 --> 01:50:03.021
Everyone, report your position.

01:50:03.021 --> 01:50:04.021
Tofu, south entrance.

01:50:04.021 --> 01:50:04.979
Potsticker, north entrance.

01:50:04.979 --> 01:50:06.271
Pork Bun, north side of the dance floor.

01:50:06.271 --> 01:50:07.812
Rice Noodle and Lucky, laundry room.

01:50:08.812 --> 01:50:09.354
Alpaca.

01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:10.771
Where's Alpaca?

01:50:10.771 --> 01:50:12.521
He gave me his earpiece, he went to get another.

01:50:12.521 --> 01:50:13.937
No new comm device activated.

01:50:13.937 --> 01:50:15.354
His badge's GPS shows

01:50:15.729 --> 01:50:16.646
he's headed to

01:50:16.646 --> 01:50:17.896
Cotai East LRT station.

01:50:25.646 --> 01:50:27.354
Him and the driver are twins!

01:51:35.312 --> 01:51:36.729
Did you mean to...?

01:51:38.604 --> 01:51:40.062
Doesn't matter now.

01:51:59.562 --> 01:52:00.437
Fragile.

01:52:01.229 --> 01:52:02.229
Lucky.

01:52:02.562 --> 01:52:03.521
Relax.

01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:05.354
Energy.

01:52:07.646 --> 01:52:08.687
Target.

01:52:09.062 --> 01:52:10.021
Amateur.

01:52:10.354 --> 01:52:11.354
Family.

01:52:11.896 --> 01:52:13.104
Shadow.

01:52:13.562 --> 01:52:14.312
Betrayal.

01:52:14.312 --> 01:52:14.937
Grateful.

01:52:14.937 --> 01:52:15.771
Blind.

01:52:20.979 --> 01:52:22.271
The times have changed.

01:52:23.104 --> 01:52:24.687
But rules are rules.

01:52:25.604 --> 01:52:26.521
Simon...

01:52:27.396 --> 01:52:28.104
Farewell.

01:52:35.437 --> 01:52:36.646
He's dead!

01:52:41.771 --> 01:52:43.187
Madam, Officer Wong,

01:52:43.187 --> 01:52:44.604
we just caught the other two.

01:52:44.604 --> 01:52:45.729
Without Shadow's direction,

01:52:45.729 --> 01:52:46.937
they had nowhere to hide.

01:52:47.437 --> 01:52:48.521
How's it going?

01:52:50.104 --> 01:52:51.521
Madam, Officer Wong...

01:53:01.437 --> 01:53:01.937
Liu Jinxiao.

01:53:01.937 --> 01:53:02.812
The artery was cut.

01:53:02.812 --> 01:53:03.396
Guoguo,

01:53:03.396 --> 01:53:04.146
press his wound.

01:53:04.146 --> 01:53:05.021
Don't let him move.

01:53:05.021 --> 01:53:06.146
Black cap,

01:53:06.812 --> 01:53:08.104
dark blue jacket,

01:53:08.104 --> 01:53:09.521
black jeans.

01:53:13.562 --> 01:53:14.396
Jinxiao.

01:53:15.146 --> 01:53:16.021
Jinxiao.

01:53:16.479 --> 01:53:17.771
Don't you sleep.

01:53:18.062 --> 01:53:20.771
Ambulance.

01:53:21.687 --> 01:53:23.354
Ambulance.

01:53:39.104 --> 01:53:40.396
I understand how you feel,

01:53:41.396 --> 01:53:43.687
but there's another unit assigned to follow up.

01:53:43.687 --> 01:53:45.187
We have a new assignment now.

01:53:49.979 --> 01:53:51.104
Then I'm taking leave.

01:53:51.437 --> 01:53:53.354
I need some time off, personal reasons.

01:54:15.771 --> 01:54:16.812
What are you doing here?

01:54:17.062 --> 01:54:18.562
Wu sent this retiree

01:54:18.562 --> 01:54:20.146
to keep someone on leave company.

01:54:21.146 --> 01:54:21.937
Eat up.

01:54:22.646 --> 01:54:23.354
Thanks.

01:54:23.937 --> 01:54:25.146
What's the status?

01:54:25.146 --> 01:54:26.271
No leads.

01:54:26.521 --> 01:54:28.729
It’s like the Shadow vanished into thin air.

01:54:47.604 --> 01:54:48.521
Money.

01:54:48.521 --> 01:54:50.646
It always leaves a trail,

01:54:51.271 --> 01:54:52.604
especially in a case like this.

01:54:57.521 --> 01:54:59.354
This is where the first victim's crypto

01:54:59.354 --> 01:55:00.896
was transferred out to.

01:55:01.146 --> 01:55:01.854
Those boys confessed that

01:55:01.854 --> 01:55:03.437
only two people know the password.

01:55:03.437 --> 01:55:04.896
One of them is dead.

01:55:05.271 --> 01:55:06.479
And the money hasn’t moved, right?

01:55:07.312 --> 01:55:07.979
Not a cent.

01:55:08.521 --> 01:55:09.479
Do you remember

01:55:09.479 --> 01:55:10.187
what I told you about

01:55:10.187 --> 01:55:11.104
what kind of thief

01:55:11.312 --> 01:55:12.521
the Shadow is?

01:55:13.479 --> 01:55:14.521
Old-timer.

01:55:14.979 --> 01:55:15.854
Old school.

01:55:17.437 --> 01:55:19.604
I know nothing about this stuff,

01:55:19.604 --> 01:55:20.646
and I’m guessing

01:55:21.312 --> 01:55:22.187
he doesn't, either.

01:55:23.021 --> 01:55:24.604
He’s still a man of that era.

01:55:28.687 --> 01:55:30.354
What do you think he'll do?

01:55:35.104 --> 01:55:37.146
He's clueless about cashing out crypto.

01:55:41.979 --> 01:55:43.604
Fu was an old-school thief.

01:55:43.604 --> 01:55:45.021
His MO back in the day

01:55:45.021 --> 01:55:47.104
was robbing jewelry stores

01:55:47.104 --> 01:55:48.896
and getting victims to buy back the loot

01:55:48.896 --> 01:55:50.396
to spare the trouble of fencing them.

01:55:56.812 --> 01:55:58.062
This is all he knows.

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:01.437
Let's eat.

01:56:01.437 --> 01:56:02.062
No time.

01:56:02.062 --> 01:56:02.687
Let’s go.

01:56:13.354 --> 01:56:14.396
Why not take the door?

01:56:16.146 --> 01:56:17.187
Why take the door?

01:56:20.812 --> 01:56:23.229
Sophia, where are you?

01:56:24.187 --> 01:56:25.062
Where's my milk?

01:56:25.896 --> 01:56:26.854
It's been days already.

01:56:27.896 --> 01:56:29.604
Did I get it wrong?

01:56:30.854 --> 01:56:32.354
Trust your instincts.

01:56:32.896 --> 01:56:34.271
Blame me if it's wrong.

01:56:36.854 --> 01:56:37.979
That's what I planned to do.

01:56:40.771 --> 01:56:42.896
I’ve been thinking these past few days.

01:56:44.896 --> 01:56:47.271
Carrying out the mission is our duty.

01:56:47.937 --> 01:56:49.646
But having blood, emotion,

01:56:50.062 --> 01:56:51.104
and a heart...

01:56:52.062 --> 01:56:53.354
That's our nature.

01:56:55.562 --> 01:56:58.354
Being a cop shouldn’t strip that away.

01:57:03.687 --> 01:57:05.562
So, back then...

01:57:08.396 --> 01:57:09.437
You did nothing wrong.

01:57:44.396 --> 01:57:45.271
Police.

01:57:45.979 --> 01:57:46.896
Everyone out.

01:57:51.021 --> 01:57:52.562
I know you want to make up a story,

01:57:53.104 --> 01:57:55.854
but don't turn yourself into an accomplice.

01:57:57.562 --> 01:57:59.229
Fu asked Wang for 10 million in cash

01:57:59.229 --> 01:58:00.229
for the account password.

01:58:00.479 --> 01:58:01.979
The meet's at Tin Seng Tea House.

01:58:01.979 --> 01:58:02.937
I'll notify Captain Wu.

01:58:02.937 --> 01:58:04.062
Don’t move until we get there.

01:58:10.562 --> 01:58:11.521
Wu, what’s your ETA?

01:58:11.521 --> 01:58:12.354
Ten minutes.

01:58:12.354 --> 01:58:12.771
Officer Wong?

01:58:12.771 --> 01:58:13.604
Under 5 minutes.

01:58:19.521 --> 01:58:21.104
We've tapped Qiuguo's phone.

01:58:21.604 --> 01:58:22.062
Copy.

01:58:22.271 --> 01:58:22.687
Copy.

01:58:26.896 --> 01:58:28.062
Sound check.

01:58:28.062 --> 01:58:29.229
Loud and clear.

01:58:30.187 --> 01:58:32.229
Wang is already 10 minutes late.

01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:33.521
He'll leave at any moment.

01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:42.687
He's leaving.

01:58:48.896 --> 01:58:49.604
Hi.

01:58:49.604 --> 01:58:51.187
Use the front door next time.

01:59:11.354 --> 01:59:12.396
Small world.

01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.896
Alone?

01:59:29.354 --> 01:59:30.646
You have the wrong person.

01:59:33.771 --> 01:59:34.771
You don't know me?

01:59:37.437 --> 01:59:38.979
We had dinner together.

01:59:39.521 --> 01:59:40.854
Forgotten me already?

01:59:45.354 --> 01:59:46.937
Do you need something?

01:59:58.687 --> 02:00:00.271
I'm so moved.

02:00:01.562 --> 02:00:03.146
It's you. Uncle.

02:00:03.146 --> 02:00:04.271
What's with the outfit?

02:00:04.271 --> 02:00:05.229
That hair of yours

02:00:05.729 --> 02:00:06.687
freaked me out.

02:00:06.687 --> 02:00:08.437
I thought you were some creepy old guy

02:00:08.437 --> 02:00:10.021
trying to hit on me.

02:00:13.604 --> 02:00:14.479
Sorry for scaring you.

02:00:15.187 --> 02:00:16.021
I apologize.

02:00:16.646 --> 02:00:17.396
No problem.

02:00:20.104 --> 02:00:21.187
You were leaving.

02:00:21.896 --> 02:00:23.812
Were you planning to tail me?

02:00:33.437 --> 02:00:34.687
All by yourself?

02:00:36.062 --> 02:00:37.104
Pardon?

02:00:37.604 --> 02:00:38.979
What are you talking about?

02:00:40.854 --> 02:00:42.021
A few days ago,

02:00:42.812 --> 02:00:43.854
you were at Wynn.

02:00:44.812 --> 02:00:46.521
You were with a boy.

02:00:50.854 --> 02:00:51.812
Where's that boy now?

02:00:58.479 --> 02:00:59.479
Dead.

02:01:00.979 --> 02:01:01.896
Broke up?

02:01:02.854 --> 02:01:04.521
Didn’t you hear me?

02:01:06.896 --> 02:01:08.104
He’s dead.

02:01:08.937 --> 02:01:09.854
Team two.

02:01:09.854 --> 02:01:11.187
Seal Ponte Cais de Coloane and R. dos Navegantes.

02:01:11.187 --> 02:01:13.771
Team three, take Entre-Campos, Cordoaria and Cheoc Van.

02:01:17.312 --> 02:01:19.229
He was killed in an LRT station.

02:01:39.062 --> 02:01:40.604
That boy was a cop,

02:01:44.146 --> 02:01:44.646
and so are you.

02:01:44.646 --> 02:01:45.687
You’re crazy.

02:01:46.604 --> 02:01:47.896
Get away from me.

02:01:49.062 --> 02:01:49.937
Go away.

02:01:59.187 --> 02:02:00.437
You've managed to stall me.

02:02:00.437 --> 02:02:01.187
Kiddo...

02:02:01.646 --> 02:02:02.479
You're pretty good.

02:02:17.729 --> 02:02:18.312
Guoguo.

02:02:20.979 --> 02:02:21.771
Call an ambulance.

02:02:22.021 --> 02:02:22.979
Police.

02:02:25.187 --> 02:02:26.021
Get out of here.

02:02:40.979 --> 02:02:42.104
Please use the front door.

02:03:43.896 --> 02:03:47.354
Liked my West Lake vinegar fish?

02:03:51.937 --> 02:03:53.187
It sucked.

02:03:53.979 --> 02:03:56.229
Go to hell.

02:03:57.979 --> 02:03:59.146
Join me.

02:06:24.771 --> 02:06:25.687
Come on.

02:06:34.396 --> 02:06:35.062
Com'on.

02:07:21.604 --> 02:07:22.521
Guoguo.

02:07:59.479 --> 02:08:00.521
Are you all right?

02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:01.396
It's not deep.

02:08:01.729 --> 02:08:02.437
I'll be fine.

02:08:04.479 --> 02:08:05.646
Backup is almost here.

02:08:05.646 --> 02:08:06.854
Earpiece is in the pocket.

02:08:07.687 --> 02:08:08.271
Guoguo...

02:08:08.687 --> 02:08:09.604
Go after him.

02:08:12.354 --> 02:08:13.229
Target headed out front door.

02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:14.437
Wig and black jacket.

02:08:15.146 --> 02:08:15.979
I'm going after him.

02:08:42.104 --> 02:08:43.937
Piggy, he's heading north.

02:08:43.937 --> 02:08:45.562
There's no surveillance in the alley.

02:08:45.562 --> 02:08:46.396
You have to find him yourself.

02:08:52.812 --> 02:08:53.854
Possible suspect sighting.

02:08:58.062 --> 02:08:58.937
It's not the Shadow.

02:09:03.646 --> 02:09:04.729
The roads are a mess,

02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:05.771
I can't find him.

02:09:05.771 --> 02:09:07.021
Qiuguo, stay calm.

02:09:08.396 --> 02:09:09.354
Get it together.

02:09:14.812 --> 02:09:15.646
I can't find him.

02:09:18.937 --> 02:09:19.521
Piggy,

02:09:19.646 --> 02:09:20.479
backup's almost there.

02:09:20.812 --> 02:09:21.771
He can't be far.

02:09:22.062 --> 02:09:22.896
You got this.

02:09:28.687 --> 02:09:30.437
Remember the key points of tracking?

02:09:30.437 --> 02:09:31.104
He Qiuguo?

02:09:33.354 --> 02:09:33.812
Watch

02:09:34.146 --> 02:09:34.812
and memorize.

02:09:35.146 --> 02:09:36.396
You only get one glance.

02:09:36.562 --> 02:09:37.604
Focus on key points.

02:09:38.104 --> 02:09:39.146
All by yourself?

02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.771
Memorize.

02:09:43.854 --> 02:09:45.562
Memorize actively first.

02:09:45.562 --> 02:09:46.271
Where's the boy?

02:09:46.521 --> 02:09:47.229
Over time...

02:09:47.354 --> 02:09:47.937
Broke up?

02:09:47.937 --> 02:09:50.229
...You'll start to memorize subconsciously.

02:09:57.812 --> 02:09:58.812
Go after him.

02:10:02.187 --> 02:10:02.771
Hand.

02:10:09.396 --> 02:10:10.146
Bandage.

02:10:28.562 --> 02:10:29.562
Target spotted.

02:10:29.562 --> 02:10:30.187
I got him.

02:10:30.187 --> 02:10:30.604
Where are you?

02:10:30.604 --> 02:10:31.854
An alley south on R. do Meio

02:10:31.854 --> 02:10:33.104
Wu, prepare for arrest.

02:10:33.104 --> 02:10:33.896
We're here.

02:10:38.729 --> 02:10:40.812
Sir, you can't take painkillers like that.

02:10:42.396 --> 02:10:43.062
Guoguo.

02:10:44.146 --> 02:10:45.146
You got this.

02:10:48.562 --> 02:10:49.312
Wait.

02:10:50.312 --> 02:10:51.229
Qiuguo,

02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:52.979
if I set a trap at the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier,

02:10:52.979 --> 02:10:54.229
can you send him this way?

02:10:55.437 --> 02:10:56.021
Captain,

02:10:56.229 --> 02:10:57.229
I can't do this alone.

02:10:57.979 --> 02:10:58.979
I need my team.

02:10:59.271 --> 02:11:00.271
I need the Surveillance Team.

02:11:00.812 --> 02:11:01.437
Piggy.

02:11:01.437 --> 02:11:02.521
Miss us?

02:11:05.187 --> 02:11:05.646
Central,

02:11:05.646 --> 02:11:06.562
Pork Bun is in position.

02:11:06.562 --> 02:11:07.437
I'm at your 8 o'clock.

02:11:07.687 --> 02:11:08.604
Potsticker in position.

02:11:08.604 --> 02:11:09.479
Parallel street,

02:11:09.479 --> 02:11:10.271
3 o' clock.

02:11:10.271 --> 02:11:11.104
Eggy in position.

02:11:11.104 --> 02:11:11.854
Tofu in position.

02:11:11.854 --> 02:11:13.187
Nine o’clock, next street over.

02:11:18.354 --> 02:11:19.521
Calling Animal Paradise,

02:11:19.521 --> 02:11:20.354
Doghead is safe.

02:11:24.312 --> 02:11:25.104
Rice Noodle in position.

02:11:25.104 --> 02:11:25.937
Two o’clock.

02:11:25.937 --> 02:11:27.771
I've studied and analyzed Shadow's habits.

02:11:27.771 --> 02:11:28.812
From the current point,

02:11:28.812 --> 02:11:31.062
there are 165 possible escape routes.

02:11:31.062 --> 02:11:34.354
17 of them reach the Chapel of St. Francis Xavier.

02:11:35.646 --> 02:11:36.521
Pudding in position.

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:37.604
Right behind you.

02:11:37.604 --> 02:11:38.354
Lucky in position.

02:11:38.687 --> 02:11:39.854
Directly ahead of target.

02:11:39.854 --> 02:11:41.896
Coordinates and directions are sent to the team.

02:11:41.896 --> 02:11:43.104
I will continue calculating his route choicecs,

02:11:43.104 --> 02:11:44.062
and you will be updated.

02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:45.562
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

02:11:45.562 --> 02:11:47.479
Adorable Unit's on-site.

02:11:49.437 --> 02:11:50.521
Alpaca in position.

02:11:53.521 --> 02:11:54.687
Calling Animal Paradise.

02:11:56.854 --> 02:11:57.812
Piggy in position.

02:11:58.146 --> 02:11:59.312
Attention, Adorable Unit,

02:11:59.312 --> 02:12:00.562
Chapel of St. Francis Xavier Square

02:12:00.562 --> 02:12:01.646
is about 280 meters northwest

02:12:01.646 --> 02:12:03.604
of the target’s current location.

02:12:04.271 --> 02:12:05.229
The Shadow's injured.

02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:06.354
He values his life.

02:12:06.354 --> 02:12:08.229
All he wants right now is to flee.

02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:10.187
He won't risk getting shot to harm you.

02:12:10.812 --> 02:12:11.729
Adorable Unit.

02:12:11.729 --> 02:12:13.062
You're the hounds now.

02:12:13.604 --> 02:12:14.729
Round up and hunt.

02:13:33.312 --> 02:13:34.271
Don't move.

02:13:39.812 --> 02:13:40.687
Hands on your head.

02:14:02.646 --> 02:14:03.396
I'm fine.

02:14:15.312 --> 02:14:16.228
I'm a cop.

02:14:16.771 --> 02:14:17.521
Fu Longsheng,

02:14:18.062 --> 02:14:19.021
you're under arrest.

02:14:22.979 --> 02:14:23.854
Madam

02:14:24.729 --> 02:14:26.229
He Qiuguo.

02:14:28.687 --> 02:14:30.021
You made this happen.

02:14:31.604 --> 02:14:32.686
You cuff me.

02:14:43.812 --> 02:14:44.604
What's so funny?

02:14:45.771 --> 02:14:47.562
You really can fight.

02:14:47.896 --> 02:14:48.479
Shut up.

02:14:49.896 --> 02:14:50.396
Guoguo.

02:15:03.479 --> 02:15:04.646
Command central,

02:15:04.646 --> 02:15:06.604
we have Fu Longsheng in custody.

02:15:13.646 --> 02:15:14.479
Well done.

02:15:15.396 --> 02:15:16.146
Your father

02:15:16.146 --> 02:15:17.104
would be very proud.

02:15:21.979 --> 02:15:22.646
Sir.

02:15:25.604 --> 02:15:26.812
Requesting to join the interrogation.

02:15:27.146 --> 02:15:28.104
Aren’t you on leave?

02:15:28.104 --> 02:15:29.521
Requesting to terminate my leave.

02:15:32.146 --> 02:15:34.187
I do miss work.

02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:37.479
We'll be needing your help in the future.

02:15:38.729 --> 02:15:39.979
I've already taught them

02:15:40.771 --> 02:15:42.146
everything I know.

02:15:43.187 --> 02:15:43.854
I'm going back

02:15:44.271 --> 02:15:45.979
to my retirement.

02:15:47.271 --> 02:15:48.937
Go to the hospital first.

02:18:57.311 --> 02:18:58.061
Officer Wong.

02:18:59.604 --> 02:19:01.771
Why are we meeting here?

02:19:01.771 --> 02:19:02.979
We found a lead.

02:19:02.979 --> 02:19:04.354
That hacker, Simon,

02:19:04.354 --> 02:19:06.436
had help from someone much more capable.

02:19:06.436 --> 02:19:08.021
My people thought so, too.

02:19:08.021 --> 02:19:09.436
We checked his computer.

02:19:09.436 --> 02:19:11.896
There is no hacking source code in his devices.

02:19:11.896 --> 02:19:14.146
The more important question is

02:19:14.146 --> 02:19:15.436
why did this mastermind

02:19:15.436 --> 02:19:18.521
deliberately leave loopholes for my people to find?

02:19:18.521 --> 02:19:19.521
Wait.

02:19:20.936 --> 02:19:23.104
I know who my people are.

02:19:24.436 --> 02:19:26.979
Your people are...

02:19:28.729 --> 02:19:30.186
Right now,

02:19:30.186 --> 02:19:31.936
you don't have the clearance yet.

02:19:33.229 --> 02:19:35.811
Are't you just a retired dogwalker?

02:19:36.354 --> 02:19:38.186
You sound like you have a secret identity.

02:19:38.396 --> 02:19:40.186
Fragile.

02:19:41.436 --> 02:19:43.186
Lucky.

02:19:44.561 --> 02:19:46.646
Relax.

02:19:48.186 --> 02:19:50.104
Energy.

02:19:52.146 --> 02:19:53.771
Target.

02:19:55.062 --> 02:19:56.687
Amateur.

02:19:57.646 --> 02:19:59.562
Family.

02:20:00.729 --> 02:20:02.521
Shadow.

02:20:03.812 --> 02:20:05.521
Betrayal.

02:20:06.979 --> 02:20:08.979
Grateful.

02:20:10.354 --> 02:20:12.271
Blind.

02:21:11.521 --> 02:21:12.937
Escalate.
